<h1>LETTERS<br>
TO A DAUGHTER</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ON_LIFE_AT_LARGE">ON LIFE AT LARGE</h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><i>Oct. 17, 19—.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My dear Alexa</span>,—</p>

<p class="indent8">You asked me to write to you
while you were away—“long letters,” you
said; and the request set me wondering a
little. I think I understand now. Comprehension
came to me in a flash as I was stropping
my razor this morning: the sharpening
of one thing helped to sharpen another—my
wits. You felt, didn’t you, that as I am a
writing sort of man, I might, in long letters,
find it possible to say things that an impalpable
something had hitherto made it difficult
for me to say when you and I were face to
face? I think, perhaps, you were right; these
long letters will show. All the same, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
have been as intimate as most fathers and
daughters; more intimate, I fondly think.</p>

<p>I should like to write at length to-day;
about 2000 words—forgive the jargon of the
trade—on the relations of father and grown-up
daughter, but you asked for letters, not
essays. Still, I might point out this, in case
it has not occurred to you before:—Those
relations are peculiar, more than that, unique.
His daughter is the only woman in all the
world for whom a man five-and-twenty years
her senior can feel no stir of passion, no trace
of that complex emotion that modern novelists
and people of that sort are so pleased to call
sex-love; the only woman from whom he
cannot possibly evoke passion in return.
That fact of itself gives his daughter a chamber
all to herself in the man’s heart, a chamber
guarded by an angel with a flaming sword.</p>

<p>To talk of love is the next thing to making
love, they say, or something like that. It is
probably not quite true; but now that I
come to think of it, when I have talked of
love to women whom I knew well, after a
quarter of an hour or so a certain tartness, a
certain uncomfortableness has come into the
talk, also one felt oneself becoming just a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
trifle artificial, less entirely frank, less spontaneous,
than one likes to be. Such talks
have ended not infrequently in tears and
temper. I need not assure you, Alexa, that
the tears were not mine: as for the temper!
And when I have talked of love to women
whom I have not known well I have sensed
a sort of agitation on both sides which seemed
to portend danger in the not dim distance.
One never felt quite sure as to what might
happen in the next five minutes. Of course,
all this refers to a long time ago. You will
understand that. There is some truth in
the old saying evidently. You might remember
it. But the point of these remarks,
as Mr. Bunsby says (it is one of your
merits that you are not ashamed to love
Dickens), lies in the application of them.
His daughter is the one young woman to
whom a man can talk of love quit of the
faintest fear of being led into making it. I
probably shall talk of love in these long letters
you asked me to write. I am not sure but
what, in any other mood and on any other
day but this, I should have said that between
men and women there is nothing else worth
talking about. But if I said that now, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
should be insincere, for I don’t feel it. This
autumn weather, this dismal lingering death
of summer, oppress my soul, and one should
be in high fettle to talk intelligently of love.
Now I am not that to-day as I look out of
the library window and see those big funereal
cedars lords of all, the whole garden subdued
to their sombre humour. Day and night the
piteous leaves of all the other trees are falling,
falling like slow rain-drops; and at twilight
they sound upon the garden paths as the footsteps
of ghosts might sound—creepy, creepy.
This morning I picked a rose for sheer pity
of it, and in half an hour its charm was gone;
its very colour had changed, its pink shell-like
petals (it was the last of the Maman
Cochets) had turned livid as the lips of a
corpse; it exhaled, not perfume, but an odour
of death. The birds flutter about aimlessly,
they seem to feel there is nothing left for them
to do in a world so full of sadness, no nests
to be builded, no broods to be reared; and
they haven’t the heart to sing. To add the
last touch of sable to the whole mumpish
outlook, you are away. Don’t think that insincere:
it is not a bit. I wandered moodily,
and with no definite object, into your room<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
to-day. It was in shocking disorder, untidiness
appalling, of course, or it had not been
yours; but somehow the chaos did not irritate
me as it usually does. Somehow I was glad
of it. Had it been otherwise—as neat as my
own study, for instance—I had been plunged
into still deeper gloom. It was like an empty
nursery in which the toys were still lying
scattered all about. Oh, the deathly chill of
an empty and tidy nursery!</p>

<p>Let me see, you are nineteen or a trifle
more, aren’t you? And Love must be lying
in wait for you somewhere very near by. I
wonder whether you will know him when you
see him. If you do, then will you be the
cleverest of your sex, and much cleverer than
any one of mine. If he is anything at all
like the Love of the Christmas cards and the
funny little poets who like to display a
smattering of classic knowledge—have no
fear of him whatever. He won’t hurt, that
chubby child with the toy bow and arrows.
Of what drivelling folly, what stupendous
ignorance were they guilty who personified
Love as a pink and pulpy baby nourished on
Pott’s Emulsion! Don’t believe them, dear.
When Love’s self comes he comes always a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
strong man armed—a warrior with old scars
upon his forehead and dints upon his shield.
And there is another mailed adventurer, too,
who may likely spring upon you unawares.
He is so like Love in his equipment and in the
manner of his attack, this one, that it is not
until forty years have passed that one can see
through his disguise. He is, by the most,
held to be unmentionable between men of
my age and women of yours, but the name
of him is Passion. If I were an ideal instead
of a practicable, work-a-day parent, I should
warn you against him in the solemnest way,
or I should pretend that there was no such a
person. But I don’t do either; first because
I know the warning and the conventional lie
would be futile, and next, because I don’t
think either would be quite fair to you.
This world is an interesting place; it
would be considerably less interesting but for
Passion’s vagaries, his adroit ambushes, his
sudden swift assaults, his slow retirements,
and, sometimes, his unexpected defeats. And
I want you to find life interesting—you are
sure not to find it happy, folk of our temperament
never do. Here I should like to
drop metaphor and dissertate for a while in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
the plain language of what some modern
writers call “psycho-physiology,” but I don’t
want to startle you, much less to shock, so I
will reserve psycho-physiology for another
time. This, however, I may say: you will
know Love from Passion just by this—that
Love wants ever to give; Passion, to take.
When the two appear as close allies—well,
then you will be upon the eve of certainly
the most momentous and, perhaps, the most
catastrophic event of all your life. There is
really no saying what may happen then,
and you had better come and talk it over
quietly with me. Don’t be afraid of Passion
because you have heard him called by uglier
names, and remember always this—that come
he by tempestuous assault or by patient siege
he never wins of his own strength alone. It
is always a traitor within the gates that
gives the citadel away. That’s the one
you have to keep an eye on—the traitor
inside.</p>

<p>I have often heard you say (you are the
only woman I have heard say it) that you
would not, if you could, be a man. I like
you the better for saying it, but you are
wrong all the same; at least I think so.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Whether men or women have the better time
I don’t know, but I do know that men have
the safer. They get more out of life, and
they risk infinitely less in the getting thereof.
In this matter of Passion, for instance (the
metaphor’s changed now), the handicap is
quite infernally unfair. It almost makes a
just man blaspheme the handicapper. It is
as though the two sexes were skating. Each
equally enjoys the exhilarating exercise. To
mine a slip means, at the worst, a ridiculous
posture for a moment or two and a few
bruises; to yours, the almost certainty of a
compound fracture, possibly of a broken
back. But perhaps in a sporting spirit you
will reply, the deadlier peril carries with
it the keener thrill; and really there may be
something in that. My observation of life,
however, convinces me to the contrary. For
me the chances of the undignified tumble and
the bruises are enough. Some of your advanced
sisters (you’ll meet them presently, if
not in the flesh, then in books) will tell you
that the tendencies of the times are all in
favour of equalising the chances. Maybe;
but put not your trust in tendencies, Alexa.
Think what you like, but act as though the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
world were going to be always just what
it is now. Pioneers are always uncomfortable,
and for that reason, mostly unpleasant.
Your business is to make life interesting, and
in so far as you do that you yourself will be
an interesting woman. At the same time,
an you love me, don’t imagine that I am
counselling cowardice or even prudence. If
cowardice be a positive vice, prudence is but
a negative virtue, and the line that divides
the two is so thin as to be often imperceptible.
As you travel through life you will find the
negative virtues, the cloistered virtues, as
Milton, I think it is, calls them, about the
least amiable and the most irritating things
you will encounter. No, don’t be a coward.
No woman with a chin like yours, and the
brain I feel sure you have inherited, need be
that. No end of obstacles and hindrances
will go down before that chin of yours if
only you thrust it forward at the exactly
right moment; realities as well as unrealities,
your living fellow creatures and the ghosts
of dead ideas. Before such a chin many a
seeming lion in the path will turn into
naught more fearsome than a spitting kitten
after all; still kittens, it is worth remembering,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
can scratch. And scratches
disfigure.</p>

<p>Try to avoid scratches: they smart, and
there is no honour in the scars thereof.
Make the world interesting to yourself, as I
charged you before, and make it comfortable.
To do that is about the most one can hope
to do ’twixt swaddling clothes and shroud.
I don’t ask you to venerate other people’s
prejudices—scorn them as much as you like;
but I do advise you to respect their power.
Bow reverentially in the House of Rimmon.
Try to imagine yourself (the effort will
not be very great after you have looked
around you for a while) a civilised being
cast among savages. The savages have, of
course, some rigid rules of conduct, of the
origin of which they know nothing and
which, for that very reason, they hold in the
deeper awe. The breaking of a rule involves
a slow scraping to death with oyster shells,
and yet such breaking gives a good deal of
comfort and satisfaction to you; there is a
thrill about it somewhere. “<i>Que faire</i>”
then? Stick to the rules like the most besotted
savage of them all? Not a bit of it;
break them just when and how it suits you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
and then use your superior intelligence.
You will get a poignant and penetrating
pleasure from the mere exercise of your
higher faculty. I am not sure but that that
alone will not be reward sufficient. All this
sounds like a lengthy way of restating the
old eleventh commandment, I know; but,
indeed, it is something more than that, it is
rather an intelligent criticism of some of the
ten and a reasonable justification of that odd
one.</p>

<p>My advice assumes, of course, that you
are a Superior Person. I think I have noted
certain traits in you which convince me that
that is rather your view of yourself. Well,
even so, you probably know little of yourself,
but yet more than any one else knows of
you. You see you are the one most nearly
interested in the diagnosis. Time will test
the correctness of your judgment; but when
he has had long enough to form an opinion
it will not matter much to you what his
opinion is. But of Time’s dealings with
your sex I shall have something to say anon.
Some one has said that the bitterest of all
regrets is that for the sins we have not committed.
That is mere cynical ineptitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>It is not the memory of omitted sins, but
the recollection of lost chances that writhes
and rankles.</p>

<h3>ON GOING TO CHURCH</h3>

</div>

<p class="right"><i>Oct. 28, 19—</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My dear Alexa</span>,—</p>

<p class="indent8">Some commonplace
person has said that the really important
part of a woman’s letter is always in the
postscript. It pains me to recognise how
often the commonplace is also the true. It
is the postscript of your pleasant letter that I
must answer to-day. “Ought I to go to
church?” you ask, and I can’t think why
you say “ought.” “Ought” is a word
which you know irritates me. It suggests
Ethical Societies and their preposterous
hymns. It raises questions of “right and
wrong,” and I feel that at my age one should
be done with questions of that disturbing
kind. And the worst of it is I don’t quite
know what you mean, for you may mean
one of two things. It may be a very little
question or a very big one you are putting.
Well, I will try to deal with both. If you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
mean ought you to go to church on Sunday
just now, when you are staying with correct
people who go themselves, then I answer
most emphatically “Yes.” To begin with
it is a mere act of politeness. You might
as well ask “Ought I to dress for dinner?”
But it is something more than that. To
stay away from church when your host and
his friends go is to challenge after-luncheon
controversy, to invite a religious polemic.
It is to advertise in the most vulgar and
objectionable way possible your irreligion,
or, if not that exactly, at least your religious
doubts. It is to make yourself prominent
and prickly.</p>

<p>But I can’t believe you mean that. A
child of mine may have prickles, but I am
happily confident that she would carefully
conceal them. What I think you do mean
is, “Is it wise, in order to make the best of
life, to cultivate the religious emotions?”
That was it, wasn’t it? “Ought I to go to
church?” was only your succinct and symbolical
way of putting it. It was neatly put,
and I congratulate you, Alexa.</p>

<p>Well, it is a big question, as I said, but
one that is comparatively easy to answer, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
the answer is obvious. It may take a long
time answering but that is the worst of the
obvious: it always does take such a long
time stating, whereas the non-obvious may
generally be put into an epigram. Who are
the nicest people you know, Alexa; the
people you like best to talk to; the people
whose judgment you most rely on; the
gayest people; the people who have the art
of treating serious things lightly and light
things with a becoming seriousness; the
<i>all round</i> people; the people whose
opinion you would most value of a poem, a
novel, a symphony, a landscape; the people
whose taste you trust? Think now, are
they not in almost every case people with
some sort of religious belief? Or, to put
it otherwise, have you ever met a really
delightful Atheist, man or woman? You
have met many worthy Atheists, I know,
persons whose moral code was as conspicuous
as a red nose, whose admirable
qualities stuck out of them like hat-pins,
persons you are almost bound in common
decency to respect; but have they been
delightful? Were you not always conscious
of a <i>want</i> in them somewhere, just as you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
are conscious of something lacking in a
person who has no ear for music, or who
does not like olives?</p>

<p>The religious instinct, the craving to get
into touch with something outside the
material world, beyond <i>the things we see</i>
or apprehend with any of our five senses
is born in us just like any other instinct.
The history of mankind is proof positive of
the fact. We have never yet caught a
primitive man—most savages are degenerates
they say; but, depend upon it, if ever we do
we shall find him going “to church,” as you
would put it. Even if we didn’t, even if it
could be demonstrated beyond possibility of
doubt that our arboreal ancestor knew naught
of religious emotion, but was contented with
his wives and his cocoanuts, it would be no
disproof of my assertion that <i>we</i>, the people
of 19—, are born with the religious instinct.
There are exceptions of course, freaks, just
as there are unfortunates born without drums
to their ears and without a liking for the scent
of tonkin beans; but we need not bother
about them. You, my child, have drums to
your ears, you keep a tonkin bean in your
glove-box, and you have the religious instinct.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
The question I am answering, remember, is:
ought <i>you</i>, Alexa, to go to church? In
other words, then, it amounts to this: ought
you to suppress an instinct? It is a question
surely which answers itself. The pleasures
of life consist in the gratification of instincts,
either inherited or cultivated. To suppress
an instinct, then, or to allow it to atrophy by
disuse, is to shut oneself off from an opportunity
of pleasure, to narrow the range of
one’s emotions and one’s intellect, to diminish
the number of one’s sensations; it is to be
incomplete, and if you are incomplete, you
cannot be delightful, Alexa. Your favourite
Heine says somewhere that a charming woman
without religion is like a beautiful flower
without perfume. He was always right when
he wrote of women. So am I.</p>

<p>But I think I hear you asking, is it true
that the religious emotions are necessarily
always pleasurable? Was it pleasure that
St Simeon Stylites felt upon his pillar? Does
the missionary experience a delightful thrill
while the savage is skinning him alive? Well,
I am not sure. I am inclined to think that
St Simeon did enjoy that cold eminence of
his, at any rate more than he was capable of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
enjoying anything else. As for the missionary,
I did meet one once who had been
partially skinned, and strangely enough, he
was just on the eve of starting to pay another
visit to the interesting island folk who had
flayed him; so we must presume it was not
so bad after all. But even were it otherwise,
my reply would be that persons like St
Simeon have cultivated their religious
emotions overmuch, and have paid insufficient
attention to the other sides of their
nature. They are like gluttons, or drunkards,
or profligates, or the musically mad. They
are religious debauchees. To spend all one’s
time in religious exercises is as bad, and
as foolish in its way, as to be perpetually
playing the piano: it is wasting your own
life and making yourself a nuisance to your
neighbours. Prayer is good, my child, but
really I think I would as soon see you always
on your head as always on your knees.
There is a line of a hymn which speaks
of Heaven as a place</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Where congregations ne’er break up</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And Sabbaths have no end.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but that was written, we may be sure, by a
religious debauchee. He was a glutton, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
fellow. Now, in this, as in all other things,
I would have my daughter be an epicure—not
a greedy pig. Talking of Epicurus, by
the way, I feel sure that if Epicurus were
alive in London to-day he would attend the
services in the Chapter House of the New
Cathedral almost daily. Yes, and not as a
mere listener to music: he would absorb the
atmosphere of the place; he would be of the
most devout. After all, the proof of the
pudding is in the eating, isn’t it?—and in
the eupeptic tranquillity that follows. You
can put the thing to a practical and a personal
test if you will. Go, sit as much by yourself
as you can in some great church—a cathedral
for choice, of course; choose some corner
where the light is broken by a stained-glass
window—the glass must not be of date later
than the end of the sixteenth century—and
stay there quietly until after the service ends.
Let the music of the organ, the clear voices
of the choir boys, the penetrating odour of
the incense, work their will upon you.
Surrender yourself wholly, uncritically, to
the influence of the place, and then, when it
is all over, and you are the last to leave, or
the last but one, say—for it were well, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
were perfect if, as you cross the chancel, you
should see one wimpled nun “breathless in
adoration” before the altar—write and ask
me again, if you can, ought you to go to
church!</p>

<p>Ah, but you, or some other girl who,
unlike you, is a little agnostic Philistine,
might say, those emotional experiences are
æsthetic, not religious. It is the music itself
that thrills, not the devotion that the music
seeks to express; it is the particles of the
incense that titillate the nostrils, not the odour
of prayer that penetrates to the soul. Not a
bit of it, Alexa, that is a callow observation
worthy only a Hall of Science lecturer.
Listen to exactly the same music played by
the same hands, sung by the same voices, in
the Queen’s Hall, and see if the emotional
effect upon yourself is in any sense the same.
It will charm you, of course, but there will
be something missing—and that something
is the satisfaction of the religious instinct,
the response of the Unseen to our craving
for relations with it. Yes, but the church
itself, the building, the pointed arches, the
clustered columns, the groined roof—have
not all these much to do with the psychological<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
effect? Of course they have. But
then the church was builded of men who had
cultivated their religious instincts: men who
believed, who felt: the building fits the
religious idea as perfectly as I hope your
latest frock fits your frame, my kiddie.
What is a great cathedral but the religious
emotion expressed in stone?</p>

<p>“And yet—it mayn’t be true,” I hear you
mutter, with a little sceptical tremor of the
lips. I don’t quite know what you mean by
“it,” and I don’t greatly care. To define
“it,” would require a big book, wouldn’t it?
It has already required big libraries full of
big books—and still the foolish squabble.
There It is all the time. So we will let that
question pass. What is true, what is a fact
as palpable as, more palpable than, the improvement
in the Strand, is the existence in
us, in you, of the religious instinct—of a
craving for personal relations with the
Unseen, as I said. Not to seek to gratify that
were as foolish as to refuse to listen to a
Beethoven sonata because you feel doubtful
whether Beethoven ever lived—whether all
his music were not written by another gentleman
of the same name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>Your mother asks me to tell you that she
thinks you ought sometimes to write to her.
“Ought,” and again “ought” and always
“ought” in this beast of a world!</p>

<h3>ON BEING DELIGHTFUL</h3>

</div>

<p class="right"><i>Nov. 8, 19—.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My dear Alexa</span>,—</p>

<p class="indent8">You accuse me of perpetually
charging you to be delightful, and of never
giving you any detailed and specific instructions
as to how to be it. I can’t help feeling
that the accusation is more than a little unjust,
that is to say, I did suffer under a sense
of injustice for a quarter of an hour or so.
It seemed to me that although I had never
taught you by way of precept, by way of
example I had not failed, for I have been
extremely charming to you, Alexa. But
reflection has caused me to realise that, perhaps,
nay certainly, you are right. Many of
the qualities that make a man charming are
the antipodes of those which render a woman
delightful. There are a few, of course, that
should be common to both, but they are few.
I will not trifle with the subject and do
outrage to your common sense by telling
you that Nature herself will teach you to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
be delightful, because I remember that you
and I long ago, when you were little more
than a kiddie, agreed that delightfulness is
the one attribute which Nature never possesses,
and, therefore, can never transmit to her
children. Nature is all sorts of pleasant
things. She is wholesome, for instance, impressive,
restorative, not infrequently magnificent—just
here and now she is damp and
abominably depressing—but she is never
delightful. Delightfulness is an achievement
of art. One may speak, accurately, of a
delightful garden; none but an indiscriminating
idiot would talk of a delightful wilderness.
An alcove decorated with tact and lighted, or
half-lighted—better—with Chinese lanterns,
might be delightful: a sunset never could
be. Therefore, my daughter, if you follow
the promptings of Nature you may be, let us
say, astonishing, but you will never be
delightful or anything like it.</p>

<p>Personally, I think you are delightful
already; but then, I am quite conscious that
that view of mine may be a paternal <i>parti
pris</i> which other people with blunter perceptions
than mine may possibly not share.
If you wish to be universally delightful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
then, you must be prepared to make of yourself
a work of Art. Nature, happily for
you—I may say this without flattery—has
given you the materials; it is for you to
work them up, remembering that a naturally-gifted
young woman is no more a delightful
young woman than a box of colours is a
picture.</p>

<p>In the eighties, when the Æsthetic Movement,
as it was absurdly called, was on
the town, we used to talk a good deal,
of “Art for Art’s sake.” It was a phrase
that gave grave offence to the Philistine,
(that was why we used it so constantly),
the Philistine who nosed in it a
danger to his own peculiar variety of morals.
You don’t often hear it now, for the Philistine
was too strong for us, and he has conquered.
And yet it was a phrase as innocent
as it was apt. It summed up in four words—nay,
in three, for one is repeated—a true
and imperishable principle. All it meant
was that Art should seek no end outside itself:
that if you set about painting a picture, say,
your aim should be just to paint a beautiful
picture, not to inculcate moral habits in a
Sunday school, or to boil your own pot by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
achieving the line in Burlington House,
or even the gold medal of the Salon. You
see the implication, Alexa? You see how
“Art for Art’s sake” applies to you just
now? If you are going to practise the art
of being delightful you must do it for the
sake of being delightful, not with any <i>arrière
pensée</i>, not with an eye to the best partners
at dances or invitations to the mansions of
the affluent. To die with the consciousness
of all your life long having been a delightful
person! Can anything be better than that,
save living with the same consciousness?
Moreover, I can’t help thinking that the best
of all preparations for the next world is to
be as nice as one possibly can in this.</p>

<p>You know a good deal; a good deal of
many things, I have seen to that. But it
would be well rather to conceal than to
display your knowledge. There is nothing
people in general like so little in woman as
knowledge, and when I say people in general
I mean people of both sexes. So you must
never put all the goods in the shop window,
or, at any rate, not all at once. Show just
as many as, and those of the sort that, will
attract the particular gazer in the window at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
the time. Therefore, affect an ignorance if
you have it not, remembering that the more
you really do know the easier is it to appear
not to know it. This seems an unreasonable
injunction, and therefore I will give you my
reason for proffering it. Broadly speaking,
human nature suffers from a passion to be
instructive. We all love to teach, to tell
things. Particularly do men love to tell
things to young women. I have often had
a man come up to me and say “Miss
So-and-So is a charming girl,” just after I
have been noticing that the charm for him
consisted wholly in the interested and receptive
manner with which she had been
listening, or affecting to listen, to such
information as he had delighted to impart.
Whenever a man talks to a young woman he
tries his best to appear a little <i>bigger</i> all
round than he knows himself to be. Unexpectedly
to check his enterprise by showing
that you know as much as he does has pretty
much the same effect upon his mind as
though you were suddenly to add twenty
years to your age, to discover wrinkles, or to
develop a squint. Of course, I do not mean
that when a man is “telling you things” you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
should sit mumchance and, as it were,
dumfounded at his erudition. A few well-directed
and intelligent questions will help
you vastly. But take care that the questions
are such as you feel pretty confident he will
be able to answer. Here I can speak to you
from the depths of my own experience.
When a pretty young woman asks me something
that I don’t know, I feel more inclined
to box her ears than to kiss her.</p>

<p>Learn early, dear student of life, to suffer
bores gladly. Remember that in so doing
you are making yourself delightful, not only
to the poor bore, but also doubly delightful
to the other persons present from whom you
have drawn him off.</p>

<p>Get as quickly as possible out of the way
of speaking of yourself, even of regarding
yourself as “a girl.” You are, I know, only
nineteen now, or is it twenty?—and there is
not much harm in it so far—but one day you
will be five-and-twenty, and then it will
sound, and will be, ridiculous. Girlishness
of speech, of thought and of manner is a
habit easily acquired and with difficulty
dropped. Let others think of you and speak
of you as a girl if they will, but don’t do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
it yourself as you hope for delightfulness.
There are few things in a small way
that give the wise and fastidious man a
nastier jar than to hear a woman well away
towards the end of her third decade refer
to herself as a “girl.” It is the fashion
of folks nowadays to try to defer their
children’s womanhood as long as possible—one
constantly hears it remarked, “how much
younger women are than they used to be!”
Don’t believe it, Alexa, they are just the
same age as ever they were. We cannot, do
what we will, keep our daughters young.
We can keep them silly, but we can’t keep
them young. Great is Art, but Nature
beats her there. Besides, this in your ear!
Just as it is hateful to hear a mature young
woman call herself a girl, so it is delightful
to hear one who really is a girl speak of
herself as a woman. I cannot tell you why—I
think I know, but it would take too
long just now, and the psychology of it is
subtle extremely—but trust me in this, it is
so.</p>

<p>Never if you can help it let a man do
for you anything you have reason to believe
he will not like doing—anything which you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
think you would not like to do were you he
and were he you. As a practical instance:
If you happen to be bicycle-riding with a
man, don’t let him drag you up the hills, or
against the wind. Even at some inconvenience
to yourself refuse the proffered aid
of his shoulder, of a bit of rope, or the
waistband of his Norfolk jacket. The aid
will be proffered as a matter of conventional
courtesy, but the fellow’s heart will not be in
it. He will like you ever so much the better
if you assert your independence; unless, of
course, he be intensely young, and then he
doesn’t count. When I was a young man I
once went skating with a very charming
young woman who told me she could skate,
and that she enjoyed the fun of it. I found
she couldn’t skate—she could only sprawl
about and tumble down when unsupported.
I had to spend the whole of that glorious
afternoon—I can smell the perfume of the
pines which stood around the lake even now
across nearly half a century of time—in upholding
her until my arms and ankles ached.
It was the only day of hard ice that winter.
That girl was not your mother, my child.
After that day she never could by any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
possibility have become your mother. When
I set out on that skating expedition I was
half in love with her; when I came home I
wasn’t! Selfish? Yes—well!</p>

<p>Now for a really unworldly piece of
counsel. Don’t be at too much trouble to
acquire or to cultivate the acquaintance or
the friendship of the rich. In the mix-up
that goes on to-day you will meet them, of
course—but they are seldom worth the
bother. There is little or nothing worth
having to be got from them. And the fact
that you have made yourself even a trifle
more agreeable to a rich man or woman than
you would have done to a poor person, is
sure, sooner or later, to inflict upon you a
feeling of self-despite, of self-humiliation. It
is as well to have as few of those sorts of
feelings as possible. A visit to a house much
bigger than one’s own, overflowing with
butlers, so to speak, is but poor recompense
for the very smallest scratch to one’s self-respect.
A woman with scars on her self-respect
is never quite delightful. You will
find it easier to be delightful to men than
to women. With men, over and above the
cultivated charm of your art, you have always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
your sex—that potent mystery—to trust to.
With women it tells rather against than for
you. Therefore double your efforts to be
delightful to women. In this matter I can
give you none of the specific details you ask
for. To them apply the golden rule—do
unto women as you would have women do
unto you. You will meet many fool-women—whom
in your heart and brain you will
contemn—but remember that the veriest
fool-woman of them all will probably be
clever enough to know exactly when and
where to stick her claws into the other
woman. Avoid those claws, my child.</p>

<h3>THE GLAMOUR OF THE FOOTLIGHTS</h3>

</div>

<p class="right"><i>Dec. 5, 19—.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My dear Alexa</span>,—</p>

<p class="indent8">I was delighted to get your long letter on
Monday. It was just the sort of letter I like
to have, from a woman especially: a letter
with naught impersonal in it, full of the
familiar and intimate turns of phrase. I
fancied I could hear the very inflection of
your voice here and there. That is the way
to write; to write to a friend, I mean. Try
hard to remember all the time that you are
not writing to a newspaper, or labouring
to produce what, at school, used to be called
“a meritorious composition.” Avoid the
<i>cliché</i> as you would the devil; nay, even
more; for he, in some of his moods, might
be interesting; the <i>cliché</i> is always tiresome.
Your letter caught me in a moment of depression,
one of those mopish moments
which come upon me oftener than they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
should of late, and lie like shadows upon the
spirit’s surface, turning to monotone what
should be all iridescence. I went down into
the breakfast-room and fired off an epigram.
It is true I had already perfected and polished
that epigram while I lay wakeful in the dead
waste and middle of the night, but I should
never have summoned energy enough to part
with it so soon had it not been for your
letter. It was not appreciated. The bacon
had been served on a coldish dish. So you
see you are responsible for that wilful waste
of a good thing, Alexa; a thing that would
have (and mayhap will yet) set the club
smoking-room in a titter. At the breakfast-table
it raised only an acidulous smile, the
merest flicker. The family looked reprovingly
at me for beginning the day so
frivolously. Had you been there, now!
That is one of your chiefest charms, my
daughter, that is why I love you so; you
always appreciate your father’s efforts to
pervert the truth.</p>

<p>There was one thing in your letter that
troubled me a little though, because I fancied
I saw in it a symptom, a foreshadowing, so to
speak, like the sore throat and little dry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
cough that herald an attack of scarlet fever.
Do you remember when you had scarlet fever
and what a pale ghost your father was for
seven dreadful days until the danger was
over and gone? Ah me! But as to this
symptom. It was only two lines in which
you said something—I don’t remember
exactly what, and I have not your letter by
me at the moment—about your “favourite
actor.” You did not mention the fellow’s
name, and I thank you for that. It has
probably saved me from the crime of assassination.
Think how disgusting it would
have been! I don’t mean the assassination
itself, that would have been jolly, but the
newspaper boys bawling up and down the
Strand, “Horrible murder of Cyril, or
Claude, or Basil Somebody-or-other!” And
your poor mother in tears at home; and then
the squalid Old Bailey, and the glib counsel,
and the solemn ass on the Bench, and the
unsympathetic stodgers in the jury box. I
feel I could never survive a criminal trial.
My spirit would break through its fleshly
casings, and flee away from the deadly
commonplaceness of the thing before it was
half over. Therefore in the days of your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
youth look not upon the mimes to admire
them, Alexa, and bring not your father’s gray
hairs in sorrow to the dock.</p>

<p>But to return to seriousness and that
symptom I spoke of. I have noticed lately
in several young women of your age, though
I am glad to say not in you, an unsalutary
tendency to exalt the mummer. I have
heard them chatter to each other about him
in the drawing-room, here; I am told (Jane
tells me in fact, she tells me unblushingly)
that they buy his photographs, sometimes as
many as three or four of one of him in
different costumes; that they stick these
photographs up on their bedroom mantelpieces,
and that in some desperate cases, they
write him letters asking for his autograph,
and even go the length of sending him
flowers. Flowers! They had far better
send onions.</p>

<p>I will not let myself think hardly of these
maidens of our day. I feel I must recognise
that after all they are but doing
what the young males of their species always
have done and still do. The glamour of the
footlights has always tempted youth to make
a donkey of itself. Young men of a like age<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
talk actress over their cheap cigars, spend
their sparse shillings on photographs of legs,
and go the full length of their limited credit
in flower shops. But, then, they <i>are</i> young
men, you see, and that makes all the difference.
It does, I assure you, and my fondest
hope is that the discovery that it does may
not come upon you as a shock. There may
be no reason, “in justice,” why there should
be one law for women and another for men,
but just now there is, and if ever there
isn’t what a deuce of a world it will be! Let
me imagine an instance of what I mean. If
a few years hence I were to come upon your
brother John with his arm round a dairymaid
(I shall not, for dairymaids are buried in the
picturesque past) I should give him a talking
to, but the amorous incident would not
break my night’s rest. But if, oh my child—if
I caught you kissing the postman!
There, you see. I know quite well you are
ill-treating that pretty mobile under-lip of
yours at the indelicate suggestion. “Indelicate,”
I feel sure that is the word you will
use. And it is, that is just what I mean it
to be. Well, there is something indelicate
in this fuss about the actor fellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>I don’t like doing it, but for once let me
pose before you as <i>laudator temporis acti</i>.
You were pretty good at Latin a year ago,
and you still keep enough of it to translate
that. I can’t conceal from myself that there
has been a change, and a change not for the
better, in the emotional atmosphere of the
young woman; it has become soppy, stuffy;
if I were to say sniffy I should not say too
much, but I won’t say quite that. Young
women have always fallen in love—I use the
phrase in its widest, vaguest sense—with Man,
with just the male creature. Had they not
we should none of us be here, I suppose.
When that nebulous emotion becomes more
definite, concentrates itself and gets directed
at a particular member of the species, it
becomes Love, the real thing, the motive
power of life, the subject matter of poetry, of
drama, of legend, of art generally. But in
its vague state it hovers over Man, just Man.
Obviously it must be over Man in some more
or less definite form. Well, now, what I
wanted to say was this. Once upon a time,
not so long ago either, young women “fell
in love” with, made a fuss over, Man in his
more heroic, more intensely masculine and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
vigorous aspects. It was the soldier, the
sailor, the adventurer of all sorts, that appealed
to their tenderest susceptibilities.
Even the highwayman was held a romantic
figure. Many a nice girl has tossed a
bouquet or waved a damp pocket-handkerchief
at a highwayman on his last drive to
Tyburn Tree. Women upon whom one
must not be too hard have before now
eloped with their grooms. I say “upon
whom one must not be too hard,” because
after all grooming is a <i>man’s</i> trade. Personable
prize-fighters, too, have had their share of
delicate feminine attentions. Now all these
types of manhood,—and, remember, it is
the type more than the individual who first
appeals to those vague unsettled amatory
emotions we are talking about,—were male
things who <i>did something</i>, something mostly
that had danger in it, that called for a spice
of hardihood, of courage, of some honest,
manly, simple quality in the doing. Venus,
you know, ’tis said, gave herself to Mars,
and tried it on—the hussy—with a robust
young hunter; but scandal does not connect
even her name with a mummer’s!</p>

<p>Now, this change in the young woman’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
emotional outlook from the hero, of sorts,
to the actor, is a change I can’t help feeling
to be for the worse. For, you see, the
object of the emotional outpouring is no
longer a man who does something, but only
a man who pretends to do something, who
postures and poses and plays at doing something!
“The Captain with his whiskers”
of whom our grandmothers sang, and at whom
our mothers were not allowed to peep through
the slats of their Venetian blinds, may have
been a bit of a dog, not “a marrying man,”
mayhap, as another old song had it; but at
least his scarlet jacket and his gold lace stood
for something, for something worth having.
That scarlet was smoke-blackened at Waterloo,
that gold lace lost its lustre on the slopes at
Inkerman. Girls don’t sing “The Captain
with his whiskers” now, and, to tell you the
truth, I’m rather glad of that. May I not
live to see the day, though I am afraid I shall,
when they will hymn the seductions of “The
actor with his grease pot.”</p>

<p>Please understand—but I need not ask
that, you always do understand me, you are
the only woman who ever has, and consequently
made the right allowances—that I do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
not say one word in contempt of the actor’s
profession as such. It is an arduous trade,
and as honest as any other whose object is to
amuse the public. They call it an “art”
now, I notice, and, perhaps it is, a kind of
a sort of an art; but my point is that it
is not a business that calls out the best, the
virile, from a man. On the other hand,
it does evoke, by the confession of lots of
actors and actresses themselves, the malign
qualities of personal vanity, petty jealousy,
and peacockiness. The constant assumption
of other personalities does and must wipe
out such personality as the man may have to
begin with. If you are always pretending to
be somebody else you must inevitably lose
your own self at last. And then, it is so
quite awfully an affair of clothes; of clothes
and of powdered wigs, and of shaven faces
and smirks. Now, I put it to you, Alexa,
do you think a delightful woman ought to
fall in love with a suit of clothes bought in
Covent Garden? Further, do you think she
can be really delightful if she does?</p>

<p>After all, perhaps, the change is not so
great, or the thing so serious as it seems.
Perhaps, when all’s said and done, it is only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
the actor in his character of hero with whom
the young woman “falls in love.” There
would be a sharp reaction, I make no doubt,
did she see the fellow himself in tweeds
guzzling brandy and soda in a Strand bar, or
even in evening dress sipping champagne at
the Savoy. And, to do him justice, sometimes,
on the stage, in the glare of the footlights,
an actor does look uncommonly like
a gentleman. You might almost fancy he
was the Sir Rupert Glenalmond or the Lord
Archibald Heavyswell he pretends to be.
But still it is, while you are about it,
better to “fall in love” with the reality than
with the sham, isn’t it? You must fall in
love with something, I know; but let it be
with the Man, not with the Mimic.</p>

<p>Therefore, Alexa dear, next time you go
to the theatre spend the dressing hour in the
cultivation of the critical spirit. That shall
save you. Be a modern girl by all means;
be as modern as ever you can, and count on
my support to the utmost extreme of your
modernity, but don’t, don’t be a little duffer.</p>

<p>Always your affectionate, if, this time, also</p>

<h3>THE RUDENESS OF WOMEN</h3>

</div>

<p class="right"><i>Dec. 17, 19—.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My dear Alexa</span>,—</p>

<p class="indent8">As in your last letter you pose me with
no puzzling questions on the subject of
conduct, I may take it, I suppose, that for
the moment, at least, life has become less
problematical to you. That is well. Even
the youngest and most intelligent of us should
cease from bothering now and then, and be
content just to be onlookers, to banish that
fearsome word “ought” from our vocabularies
and from our minds. Conduct, as
Matthew Arnold pointed out a long time
ago, is three-fourths of life, a biggish fraction,
but, after all, a fraction only; and there come
periods when we thank our stars for the comparative
restfulness of that odd quarter. I
often think that Matthew might, with advantage,
slightly have expanded his formula.
Had he said that conduct is three-fourths of
life <i>for</i> three-fourths of life he had been
nearer the mark. Men and women, but more
often men than women, I fancy, who have
passed the third quarter rarely worry themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
as to what they ought, or ought not,
to do. They just go ahead and do it, confident
that whether the action turn out for
weal or for woe it has been decided for them
in that other three-quarters left behind and
beyond recall or undoing. We spend the
greater part of our life in acquiring habits,
and the lesser in acquiescent obedience to
them. Therefore, if you are to be a delightful
middle-aged lady you must practise sedulously
to be a delightful young one. It is
worth a bit of hard work to begin with, for
middle-age lasts longer than youth, and
middle-aged ladies who are not delightful are
not anything; they simply don’t count.</p>

<p>One little habit I advise you to cultivate,
to cultivate until it becomes as natural and as
spontaneous as eating peas with a fork; it is
the habit of saying “Thank you” for minor
services rendered. We are all of us taught
that in the nursery, I know, but an uncountable
number of us, or rather of you, seem to
forget it when you lengthen your skirts.
Let me tell you something that happened
only yesterday. I went up to Charing Cross
by a mid-day train from here. The only
other person in the carriage was a woman.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
She was a lady—you know what I mean—the
sort of woman who lives in a hundred-a-year
house, who keeps three maidservants
and a boot boy, possibly a carriage, and who
goes for a month or six weeks to the Continent
or elsewhere every autumn with her
husband. The sort of person who when
she gives a small dinner party has little
pink shades over the candles and at least
two sorts of wine. I think, by the way, she
was the sort who would call a table napkin a
serviette, but perhaps I’m prejudiced by what
happened. Well, when she reached Blackheath
she rose to leave the carriage. I was
sitting in the corner by the door through
which she had to get out, and, of course, I
opened it for her. If you sit by the door
you have to open it for all the outgoers. It
is a nuisance, but it has its compensation in
the extra comfort of the corner seat. This
woman did not say “Thank you”; she
passed me without even an inclination of her
sulky head. Presently two other women got
in, two women of the same social standing as
the one who had left. At Lewisham one of
these got out. I opened the door for her.
She didn’t say “Thank you.” At London<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
Bridge precisely the same thing happened
with the remaining third. All the way thence
I meditated on writing a stinging letter to
the <i>Times</i> on “The Decadence of Manners
in the Upper Middle Class,” but you
who know me know that the letter is still to
write. What happened psychologically to
me was this: that I felt just a trifle less
regard and respect for your sex, Alexa, than I
was conscious of when I left home. I daresay
it was unreasonable of me, but there it
was. Women of our class are not really
nice, I found myself saying to myself, not
really and truly nice in the innermost soul of
them. No wonder they don’t get on with
their servants, I thought to myself, for if
they are rude to their social equals, what
must they be to those whom they think their
inferiors? I rather hated your sex for about
twenty-five minutes. And please don’t tell
me that these impolite hussies were exceptions,
because on the balance of probabilities
it is most unlikely that I should have struck
three exceptions in the course of one short
train journey. No, Alexa, you are very rude.
You are attractive sometimes, I admit; you
are even, in passing moments of folly and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
madness, bewitching, but you are very rude.
I don’t mean you personally, of course, but
you regarded collectively—you women, you!</p>

<p>I find myself getting cross even now as I
write when I recall that incident, getting cross
and asking myself all sorts of questions which
it were well for women that men should not
ask. As, for instance: Why do we put up
so tamely with so much of your cheek?
Cheek is a slang word, but made venerable
by long use, and I can think of no other so
exactly adequate, so comprehensively expressive.
Why do we not give you more severe
talkings to than we do? They would do you
no end of good, and we know it, and yet refrain.
You scarcely ever get a severe talking
to, any of you. Yesterday, after leaving
Charing Cross Station, I walked up Bond
Street. I was really going somewhere, oh
sceptical child; you must not think your
father was merely loafing. I was not in a
hurry, and I looked at the shops. There
were lots of pretty women driving up and
down in their carriages, but I did not look
at them; I was at odds with the whole sex.
Well, those shops! With the exception of
a fishmonger’s, a few most attractive tobacconists,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
in which you cannot get a briar root
pipe under 25s., and a stray tailor or two, all
those shops were women’s shops; full of hats
for women to wear, each hat to be worn about
twice, or at the most half-a-dozen times;
shops full of frocks, each frock costing more
than a week’s earnings of a man who works
hard to make, say, £2000 a year; shops
creaming over with fluffy, frilly under-things,
the fluffiest and the frilliest of which disappear
for ever when once they leave the shop, or, let
us say, almost disappear. And then the
jewellers! Rubies, emeralds, sapphires, opals
in little heaps on velvet-lined trays. Diamonds
and diamonds, and yet more diamonds
flashing in the sunlight, flashing scorn and
contempt upon all such as are too poor to
purchase them; and gold, gold enough to
have paved the street! Oh, and the pearls,
the ropes, nay, rather the cables of pearls.
Pearl fishing, they used to tell me in my
<i>Child’s Guide to Knowledge</i>, is a perilous
profession, and a profession followed wholly
by men. And all the things that these shops
displayed—of course, there was more than as
much again in drawers and cupboards and
stout iron safes within the shops—were to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
bought by men and given to women. For
what? For what, in the name of reason?
Men, merely as men, give to women as much
as women, just as women, give to men; and
so that part of the account is squared by
nature’s self, as it were. But all this balance,
this ransack of Bond Street, of South African
and Eastern and Australasian mines, of ocean
depths, of forest solitudes, all this is collared
by women, and they won’t even say “Thank
you.” It is true I did not give those three
women yesterday any jewels to speak of; but
still I did save them the soiling of their
light-coloured gloves, and you know by
experience, Alexa, that carriage door handles
on our railway are always filthy.</p>

<p>Forgive this outburst, which, after all, so
far as you are concerned, is quite impersonal,
but out of the bitterness of the heart the
pen writeth. You want to be, and I want
you to be, an exceptional woman, and the
easiest way in which to be an exceptional
woman is to be a polite one. I don’t think
there is any radical difference between the
sexes in the way of politeness. We are all
born impolite—there is nothing much more
impolite than a young baby—but one sex<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
acquires politeness and the other doesn’t—that’s
where it is. I wonder if you have
ever noticed that. If not, just use your
eyes for the next four-and-twenty hours, and
once more you will be compelled to admit
and to admire the accuracy of your father’s
criticisms of life. Watch, watch closely,
next time you see two or three young men
talking to two or three women in a drawing-room
or at a garden party. Notice the
difference (it is not a subtle, it is a quite
blatant difference) between the attitude and
tone of the men to the women and those of
the women to the men. Unless the men be
rank outsiders, and that sort is not likely to
come your way, you will find in the men’s
attitude and tone a deference, a respectful
diffidence—how shall I put it?—quite lacking
in the women. However foolish, jejune,
inconsequential be the remarks of any one of
the women the man immediately talking to
her will put on an air of interest; he will
treat her as though anything she said had
some real importance; he will receive her
feeblest joke as though it were wit of the
most polished. But she, well, if he doesn’t
amuse her she won’t even try to look amused,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
and if he bores her she will most unmistakably
look bored. It is horribly impolite to
look bored, you know. To bore is beastly,
but to look bored is damnable. Most women
behave as though their mere existence were a
blessing to men, as though all that men could
possibly ask of them was just to be there!
It is not enough, you know, Alexa; it really
isn’t, and in our saner moods we men feel
that. We don’t say unpleasant things of
you, but we feel them.</p>

<p>The worst of it is that social custom accepts
the woman’s point of view and enforces
it. Think what happened to me last week.
It was on Wednesday—on Wednesday your
mother and I dined with the Devrients.
Your mother was all right from start to finish.
She was taken down by Forsyth—I know
you rather admire him, and you are right,
for he is about as clever as they make them,
and talks even better than he writes. But,
then, your mother is a woman, and these
sort of things are arranged for the likes of
her and you. But I! In obedience to that
monstrous social convention which pairs off
married men with married women—I never
felt it so bitterly before, for your friend, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
beautiful Janet, was there and sat opposite
me, hidden behind a tall epergne of tall
flowers, and I’m fond of Janet, and you say
she likes me—I was sent down with Mrs
⸺ (never mind, I won’t mention names),
a middle-aged woman, who has no beauty
nor traces of beauty, who is neither clever
nor interesting, who is nothing, so far as I
could make out, but stupid and rather greedy.
For the whole of that awful dinner—it lasted
from eight until a quarter to ten—I had to
make myself agreeable to that preposterous
person. And I did it. I was as nice and
kind as anything. I plied her with banalities,
such as her soul (what there was of it)
loved. I wouldn’t have minded her not
being intelligent had she been pretty. I
wouldn’t have minded her not being pretty
had she been intelligent; but she was neither,
and at the end of it I felt as though my brain
had been wiped out with a sponge. Now,
there was a man there with whom I particularly
wanted to talk, he is one of the few
men out of whom one always sets an idea or
two, but devil a word could I get with him,
and all because it is taken for granted that I, a
man, must needs want to sit next to a woman.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
On the way home your mother remarked
what a delightful evening it had been, and
how quickly it had passed! I said—but
you who know me, Alexa, know quite well
that I said nothing.</p>

<p>The Registrar-General’s returns inform
me that men are marrying less freely than
they used, and that each year they marry less
freely than in the year before. It is almost
the one piece of evidence I can discover of
the growth and development of intelligence
among my sex. It means, say the commentators
in the newspapers and the magazines,
that men are getting more selfish,
more exacting. It does. As we get more
and more civilised so shall we demand more
and more from life. My savage ancestor
asked but little here below. I ask quite a
lot, and get some. My remote descendant
will ask more, and get all of it. Of course,
men who fall in love will continue to marry;
the Registrar-General will always have them
to go on with. For a man in love the <i>mere
girl</i> suffices. But hitherto the marriage returns
have been made up by the marriages of
a certain number, and a pretty large number,
of men who have not been in love and who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
consequently can see things, I mean women,
more or less as they really are. For them
the mere girl does not suffice. She has got
to be a nice girl as well, a girl who takes as
much trouble to be nice as she does, say,
to be clean. These are the fellows, I feel
certain, whose defection has caused, and will
further cause, the fall in the marriage rate.
Your sex is being found out, my child, found
out at long last by mine. When the discovery
is quite complete Lord only knows
what sort of a world we shall have!</p>

<p>I don’t suppose it has ever struck you
before how nice we are to you—now
has it?—how patient we are with your
caprices, how tolerant of your tempers,
how semi-blind to your deficiencies, how
little and how rarely we use against you the
strength, moral, mental, and physical, that
is ours. An excellent French priest once
advised me, as a cure for discontent, to spend
half an hour three times a week in meditating
upon my blessings. You do that, Alexa,
and don’t forget that perhaps, on the whole,
the chiefest of yours is the possession of a
most wise and always a most loving</p>

<p class="right"><i>Jan. 2, 19—.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My dear Alexa</span>,—</p>

<p class="indent8">Don’t be alarmed at getting a letter
from me not in reply to one of yours.
Nothing has happened. “All is silver grey,”
as Andrea del Sarto says. I won’t add “placid
and perfect with my art” as he does, because
it is cheek to call one’s work perfect even
when it is, but, at any rate, both I and my
art are placid enough.</p>

<p>No, nothing has happened. That is the
worst of it. When one reaches my age
nothing ever does happen unless one makes
it happen. When one is young adventures,
excitements, thrills, come suddenly out of
the void, thus adding to the ordinary joy of
them the throb of the unexpected. But when
one is older one has to fare forth out into the
void and seek diligently adventures, excitements,
thrills; and if one has one’s living to
earn, and a whole lot of little things to see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
after, why then one hasn’t much time for
excursions into the void.</p>

<p>This is a purely selfish letter. It is written
to relieve my mind; by way of getting down
in black and white some thoughts that have
been twisting and twirling about like maggots
in my brain all the afternoon. In that respect,
at least, I am an artist, Alexa, and, forgive me,
my daughter, in that same respect, you are
not.</p>

<p>The artistic temperament is not, as fools
of novelists appear to think, an itching to be
singular or noticeable in any way, an inclination
to wear ridiculous neck-ties, to omit to
wash behind the ears, or to live with people
to whom one is not married; and to quarrel
with them. It is the desire, the invincible
desire, to externalise and express in paint or
pencil, in clay or marble, in musical sounds
or in written words, one’s emotions, one’s
thoughts, one’s aspirations, one’s dreams.</p>

<p>You, for instance, draw. For a girl of
your years and training you draw rather well.
But when you see a thing that appeals to you—a
face, a landscape, a little bit of an interior,
you do not ache and ache until you have got
it down in pencil upon paper. You are quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
content to keep it within you. I, when I get
ever such a stupid idea in my head, am miserable
until I see it before me in words, in words
arranged as well as I know how to arrange
them. I would rather, far rather, keep an
aching tooth in my jaw than an aching idea
in my head. And so, though my neck-ties
are ever the correctest of their kind that Bond
Street knows, and though I never do any of
those other things peculiar to the artistic temperament
of rubbishy fiction, I do claim to
belong to the great company of artists.</p>

<p>By the way, I have often wondered what
the author of the <i>Te Deum</i> was about not to
have added another line to it:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

<p>Every artist, in every bit of honest work
he does, though he may not mean it or know
it, praises God. How supremely well Kipling
expressed the gist of our creed when he wrote
in that exquisite <i>Envoi</i> to “Life’s Handicap”;
you remember it:—</p>

<p>And now to come down from the heights<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
to the valley—I never could breathe freely
on mountain tops, Alexa; that’s why I hate
Switzerland so cordially. It is not the touring
Anglican clergy and their impossible wives I
object to so much; it is those appalling Alps.
But, as I was going to say, I write this letter
because I spent a whole half-hour this morning
reading a woman’s paper. At least, I’m not
sure it called itself a woman’s paper, it might
have been a woman’s page in an ordinary
paper. I don’t know where the thing has got
to now, so I can’t refer to it. I found it on
the hall table when I came down to breakfast.</p>

<p>Doesn’t it make you feel a good deal
ashamed of your sex and of yourself, as one
of it, when you come across a woman’s page
in a newspaper? Doesn’t it make you feel
pretty much as you would feel if you saw
someone of your own standing behaving
rudely at dinner? or being impolite to a
child? Don’t you ask yourself, with something
as near to a swear word as you can get,
“Whom on earth is all the rest of the paper for
then? Are women so small, so narrow, such
children, such idiots as to have no interest in
politics, in art, in science, in literature; in all
the extraordinary doings of human beings all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
over the world, such as the rest of the paper
discusses and records?”</p>

<p>“The Women’s Corner!” Think of it,
Alexa, child of my heart! The corner into
which the poor stunted, shrivelled, petty-minded
creature must betake herself to read
about dress. Pah!</p>

<p>Here your feminine intuition will tell
you that I am in rather a bad temper. There,
there, I don’t mean to sneer at feminine
intuition. Heaven knows I have both
profited and suffered from it enough, and
more than enough in my time, and when the
sum comes to be cast up it will be found, I
daresay, that I have profited as much as
I have suffered.</p>

<p>But I am in rather a bad temper with that
woman’s paper, not because it was all about
dress, but because it was all wrong about
dress. I don’t mean wrong in the absurd
details—I know nothing of them—but wrong
in the essence, wrong in the soul of it.</p>

<p>Here anyone but you would say “What
in the world does the man mean by talking
about soul in an article on dress?” You
won’t say it because you know—we have
agreed about it often—that an article on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
anything whatever that has no soul in it, is
not an article at all; it is just a bladder of
rattling peas.</p>

<p>It is not because I despise or even think
lightly of dress, that I am so unwontedly
annoyed with the person who wrote all this
slops. On the contrary, it is because I am
fulfilled with the idea of the importance of
dress and of the part it plays in the amenities
and pleasures of life. You have often told
me after we have been out together, or
people have been here, and I have been
admiring this lady or that, that I did not
even know what she had on. Precisely.
That was because she was well-dressed. Had
she been badly dressed I should have known
fast enough. The woman is well-dressed
of whose costume you remember only the
<i>ensemble</i>, what we artists call the total impression—an
impression of colour and contour.
Or sometimes of nothing even so
definite as that, of fluffiness merely.</p>

<p>Now the writer of all this abominable
fustian knew nothing of that, that elementary
philosophy of dress. He, she, it—I don’t
know what the sex of the creature was—thought
all of the costume and nothing of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
woman. With him, her, it, the woman was
a thing to be worn with a costume, not the
costume a thing for a woman to wear. You
do see the tremendous difference, don’t you?
But, of course, you do.</p>

<p>Really—but there, one must be tolerant.
These people are flatly ignorant, and, moreover,
they are the hirelings of others whose
business it is to make money out of dress.
That, nowadays, at anyrate, is the meaning
of fashion in the restricted sense of the word.
Fashion is not a mode of being beautiful or
even of changing from one variety of beauty
to another, or of changing to meet changing
circumstances. It is a means of putting
money into the pockets of dressmakers and
manufacturers. These people are getting
stronger and stronger, more and more
arrogant.</p>

<p>Take a case in point. Once upon a time,
not so long ago, every woman in our class
had what was called “a set” of furs. It was
horribly expensive to begin with, but it was
taken care of and it lasted, oh, I don’t know
how long. Of course, that didn’t suit the
furriers and fur sellers—the fierce competition
of commerce and all the silly rest of it—and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
so, though the wearing of furs is still the
comfortable fashion, each season sees a change
in the smaller fashion of the furs, the cut of
them, the kind, and so on, and the women
even in our class, who don’t adopt the latest
thing, feel hopelessly uncomfortable and out
of it. They either go cold, or wear cat-skin
or rabbit-skin faked to look like something
expensive, or spend money that they haven’t
got.</p>

<p>With that rabbit-skin and cat-skin I have
struck the note of fashion as it is in the
suburbs, the provinces, and everywhere else
except among the rich and idle people to
whom money does not matter, the people
who do nothing to make money, and so have
most of it to spend. The designers for the
big dressmakers design something that is
perhaps, though by no means certainly,
beautiful enough. If perchance it be beautiful,
its beauty lives in the artistry and science of
its fashioning, and the material of which it
is made. Now the people at the top can
purchase, without feeling it, the artistry, the
science, the rare and costly material. But
the others, you see, can’t.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, pricked and spurred by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
low-down fashion journalists, they feel that
life is a desert without the new thing in some
shape or another. So they get it inartistically
designed, unscientifically cut, and of some
cheaper, commoner stuff. Result, they don’t
look a bit like Duchesses after all, but only
like what they are, silly and snobby women.
These are hard words, Alexa, but I am cross
to-day.</p>

<p>Fashion in its smaller sense, “the fashion”
as it is forced upon women by the dressmakers
and designers, as a card is forced by a sharper
on a flat, is for nine people out of ten an
accursed thing, a monstrous thing. It assumes
that all women will look well dressed in the
same way. Now, if anything is certain, it is
that of any hundred women selected haphazard,
not more than ten can dress in the
same way and look anything but ridiculous.
The human body is, as you learnt when you
used to draw it at the Slade and at Colorossi’s,
a subtle thing, and demands the subtlest treatment.
There are idiosyncrasies of body as
there are of mind. I don’t mean merely
that some women are tall, some short, some
thick, and others thin, some curvy and others
angular. That has to be remembered, too,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
but I mean something more elusive than
that.</p>

<p>Let us take a concrete case. You are not
very different in height or form from your
friend, Berta Roselli. You are not a bit
prettier. A person just looking casually at
you two—a second-rate milliner sort of person—would
say that the same sort of costume
would suit you both equally well. Yet how
delightful you used to look in those frocks
which you call, I think, “Princess” frocks,
and how completely they took away the
delightfulness from Berta. I told her so
once in so many words when we were walking
round the garden together, and she had
the good sense never to wear them again.
If you ask me why they enhanced your charm,
and destroyed Berta’s, I can’t tell you. Perhaps
there is no “why.”</p>

<p>Then again, colour. It drives the artistic
soul furious to be told that “heliotrope is to
be fashionable in the approaching season,”
because one knows at once what one is in for.
Think of heliotrope or of any other colour
or tint in the universe worn beside every sort
of complexion, with every sort of shade of
hair! It makes one’s nerves stand on end<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
like quills. There again, the rich women
score because they can, and do, change their
complexions and their hair to “match,” as
this putrid paper calls it, the fashionable
colour. The poorer women try to do the
same thing, and look—well. Or don’t even
try, and then!—</p>

<p>This is merely a grumbling letter, not a
didactic essay, and so I will offer no advice in
it. To offer advice one should be in a judicial
mood, serene, detached! but I may just say
this. The one fatal thing in dress is to wear
anything because you happened to have admired
it on someone else, and for that reason
only. The one triumphant thing in the
matter of dress is to remember that you are
yourself and not that other person. In all
other matters women seem to remember it
easily enough. In the matter of dress only
do they lose their sense of identity.</p>

<p>Now, Alexa, turn on me, do, and <i>riposte</i> by
telling me that men are every bit as bad; that
they too are the slaves of fashion. Say things
about my waistcoats if you like; I don’t care,
for I have a crushing retort up my sleeve.
Think of the things that tailor people have
tried to force upon us and how miserably they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
have failed; how they have tried to make us
go back to peg-tops, to wear coloured coats
and knee-breeches, as evening dress. Think
of these things and withhold the gibe. Or,
don’t. I do not mind. Sedate in my sense of
my sex’s immeasurable superiority,</p>

<p class="center">I remain,</p>

<p class="center">Your angry and æsthetic</p>

<h3>A MORAL QUESTION</h3>

</div>

<p class="right"><i>Jan. 15, 19—.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My dear Alexa</span>,—</p>

<p class="indent8">Your last letter interested and amused
me vastly, as I know you intended it
should. It is much the best thing in the
way of writing you have ever done. I read
and re-read and read it yet again after breakfast,
and then I carefully, though regretfully,
burnt it. One can spare oneself and others
a lot of unhappiness by the simple process
of burning letters, especially women’s letters,
more especially still charming women’s charming
letters. Indeed, the more charming the
woman and the more charming the letter the
more urgently do the flames clamour for
their rights of destruction. Had anyone
else read this last letter of yours, say, ten
years hence, they would have formed an
entirely false impression of you, and had even
you read it yourself after that lapse of time
you would have formed almost as false an
impression of yourself. Almost, I say, not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
quite, for you, I fain hope, would remember
the sort of man to whom it was written.
And it is the character of the recipient even
more than that of the writer which gives the
keynote of every letter worth the reading.
An intimate letter is the achievement of <i>two</i>
personalities—it is a kind of dialogue in
which one of the interlocutors is silent, or
rather, is heard only by the other. That
is why published letters nearly always lack
interest; we do not hear that other.</p>

<p>Now, if anyone but your understanding
father had read that last letter of yours, they
would have thought you “not quite a nice
girl” to have repeated little bits of scandal
which you have picked up in a house in
which you are a welcome guest, and to have
criticised so freely your hosts and their
friends. They would have liked the letter,
mind you—they would have chortled over
it in pharisaical glee—I chortle, too, but
I chortle not as the Pharisees chortle—but
they would not have liked you, for they
would have feared and distrusted you, as
critics are always distrusted and feared by
the stodgy, especially critics of life. They,
you see, these hypothetical but now impossible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
readers of your letter, would not have
known me—would not have known, as you
do, that I enjoy scandal and appreciate
criticism; and would therefore have failed
to realise how dutiful a daughter you were
in giving me the things I like.</p>

<p>Need I, to a girl of your perceptiveness,
attempt to justify the enjoyment of scandal?
Surely it is the exceptional, not the ordinary,
which should and does interest us. If, for
instance, one were to discover a pork butcher,
who spent all the daylight hours in butchering
pork, witching the midnight with an
exquisite performance of Bach’s Chaconne
on a Strad, one would be interested in the
man, not because he was a pork butcher, but
because he was a virtuoso who loved Bach
and possessed a Strad. If Dr. Clifford were
caught with a guitar serenading a lady’s maid
in Gower Street, how one’s interest in the
man would spring to life—how much of his
windy rhetoric would instantly be forgotten?
One side of our heads would condemn him,
no doubt, but how the whole of our hearts
would warm to the man? Ah, that one
touch of nature! Forgive the banal quotation,
but I don’t often quote from other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
people’s works, do I? Well, then, scandal
is interesting because it is exceptional. And
conduct that is not exceptional is not scandal.
No one would call the improprieties of
Messalina scandals; they were just the
commonplace occurrences of her daily life.
Now, these four persons of whose doings
you tell me are made interesting to me now
by the very fact that I have always held them
to be of the properest sect of the proper.
Next time I meet Mrs ⸺ (I had better
omit the name) I shall look at her from an
entirely different point of view. I shall make
an effort to talk to the woman, whereas, as
you know, last time I took her down to
dinner I devoted myself in esurient silence
to the entrées. See now, my daughter, what
a kindly act you have done her in repeating
that little morsel of scandal. For, as you
know, when I do try to talk—really to talk—I
generally succeed rather well. You have
assured the dear and erring lady at least one
pleasant dinner party.</p>

<p>But you ask me—or seem to ask me,
though you do not put your query in so
many words, what ought to be your own
attitude to the lady in question—should you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
continue “to know” her, as the phrase goes,
in the future. Of course, you can’t help
knowing her just now, for a guest must
needs be courteous to fellow guests, or leave
the host’s house as quickly as is compatible
with politeness. Very well, Alexa, let us
go into this matter for a moment. What do
we, you and I, know of this lady, “know for
certain,” as the phrase goes? We know her
to be a kindly if not an obtrusively intelligent
person. We know, if you come to
think of it, quite a lot of nice, kind things
she has done for other people, things she
might have left undone and caused no
remark, superfluously kind things, that is.
We know her to be—for we have seen her
in her own home—a devoted and efficient
mother—alas that the two terms should not
be synonymous—to her little children.
Judging by her husband’s conduct to her, he
finds her an eminently satisfactory wife.
Personally, though I have never heard her
say a brilliant or even a clever thing, I have
never heard her say an unkind one. As to
this other matter of which you tell me, we
are not quite sure that it is true, are we?
A thing that is neither confessed nor proved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
is doubtful, and according to the wholesome
custom of English law—and English law,
broadly speaking, is English common sense—the
accused has always the benefit of the
doubt. But, you seem to hint, you yourself
are “morally certain” that it is true. Moral
certainties lead often to immoral judgments,
Alexa, and, like moral victories, are always
eminently unsatisfying. But let us take it
for granted that it is true. What then? It is
assuredly nothing that immediately concerns
you or your relations with the woman, is it?
You do not catch yourself desiring to follow
her example in any way, do you? You find
no trace of her backslidings in her conversations
with you? So far as you can
perceive, and you have pretty sharp eyes, my
daughter, it does not affect her life or
manners in any way whatever. You told me
you know, that it came upon you as an
overwhelming surprise. You may reply that
such a thing “<i>must</i>” in some way affect a
woman’s life. I reply that it is not with
what <i>must</i>, but with what <i>does</i> perceptibly
happen that we in this practical work-a-day
world only are concerned. We do well to
leave <i>musts</i> to the hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>In asking yourself whether you shall or
shall not continue “to know” this lady, you
are really and essentially asking yourself
whether you shall act as judge, jury and
executioner to a person accused of an offence
against current convention, or, yes, if you
like, against current morality. But I would
point out to you that even in Law, which is
at best but a rough and ready attempt to
secure justice, the peculiar facts of the
offence, the temptations that led up to it,
are taken into some sort of account. The
plea of extenuating circumstances has weight.
Moreover, the accused is allowed to speak in
his defence either by his own lips or those of
skilled counsel. Now your court, the court
which you in secret hold, and where you
alone are judge, jury, prosecutor, and witnesses—your
court knows nothing, and can
know nothing, of peculiar facts, and of
special temptations—it can mitigate nothing
on account of extenuating circumstances,
because it is wholly ignorant of their existence
or non-existence. The accused’s lips are
sealed, and there is no counsel to plead for
her. Do you think, then, that a court so
constituted is at all likely to get anywhere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
near to justice in its decisions? How would
you like to be tried, and executed, by such a
court, if you were charged with stealing a
yard of ribbon?</p>

<p>You may reply, and I think you will, for
you are a persistent little dialectician when
you like, that an analogy is not an argument.
And, besides, that in talking of “execution”
I exaggerate: that anything so unimportant
a person as yourself may do can matter but
little to the lady. No, perhaps not, but it
matters a good deal to you, child, and it is
you with whom I am concerned. An unjust
act hurts the doer, hurts especially if it be a
stupidly unjust act. After it he will be a
trifle stupider, blunter, more prejudiced than
he was before. There is nothing roots
itself—no, not even the horse-radish in our
garden—so easily, and is so hard to eradicate,
as prejudice. Now prejudiced and
strong you may be, my child, but you can’t
be prejudiced and delightful, and, as I have
so often told you, above all things I want
you to be delightful.</p>

<p>So far you are delightful, and you are
strong, too, and it is because you are strong
that I am going to say one thing more on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
this matter. The moral code of society is
not equally valid in all its clauses. Some
are of more importance and significance than
others. Those which say we must not
murder and we must not steal are of immeasurable
importance, because they apply
not to this time or that, or to that place or
this, but to <i>all</i> times and to every place. A
society which permitted or winked to any
extent at murder or theft would cease, almost
at once, to be a society. We are here now
living in comparative comfort and security
because societies in the past forbade murder
and theft; therefore the commands which
treat of these offences are of what we philosophical
old buffers call universal validity.
But there are other commandments in the
moral code of the day which are only “of the
day,” as it were. Time was when they were
not—places are where they are not, and possibly
time will come again when they will not
be. The morality which they seek to maintain
is never more than the morality of a
phase in human evolution. It may be valid <i>for
that phase</i>, but it has not universal validity.
Now, judgments and actions based on
universal validity must needs be ever so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
much more assured than judgments and
actions based on phasal validity, if you will
allow the phrase to pass. Don’t misunderstand
me. I don’t want to minimise the
importance of the rules and regulations which
are “only of the day,” for, after all, that day
is the day in which we live. Still, you see
there is a difference, isn’t there? Yes, and
it is just one of those differences of which a
wise and delightful young woman should
take count.</p>

<p>Of course, I have not nearly exhausted my
subject, but I have very nearly exhausted
myself, and</p>

<h3>THE LIMITS OF FLIRTATION</h3>

</div>

<p class="right"><i>Feb. 20, 19—.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My dear Alexa</span>,—</p>

<p class="indent8">What a very short note! Its brevity
and its interrogativeness give it almost
the urgency of a telegram. And yet
how am I to answer it, how am I even to
begin to answer it in less than half a dozen
pages of quarto?</p>

<p>I will not remind you of the old saying
that a certain sort of person can ask more
questions in five minutes than a wise man
can answer in a lifetime. I will not remind
you, I say, because you are not the sort of
person the old saying means, and I feel
sure that when you asked your question you
did not do it just to annoy, but because for
some reason or another you really wanted
to know. Was it personal, that reason?
Because, if so, I think, perhaps, on the
whole you had better come home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>What, you ask me, are the limits of
flirtation? Where does it begin; where
end?</p>

<p>I wish you hadn’t used the word: it is a
word I happen intensely to dislike, to dislike
with one of those prejudices of which we
can never give a satisfactory account. I
think, perhaps, I dislike it because it always
brings before me a mental image of one of
my own sex making a fool or a rogue of
himself. And yet I cannot blame you, for I
myself have been quite unable to find a
synonym for it.</p>

<p>“Coquetry” is a pretty word, but
coquetry, I quite recognise, is a different
thing. Coquetry is exclusively feminine.
Now it takes two to make a flirtation, and
one of them must not be a woman. And
then, after all, the word has a worthy
ancestry.</p>

<p>Do you know who invented it? A dozen
pairs of gloves to one you don’t? It was
that greatest of all gentlemen that ever were,
Lord Chesterfield, and he, like the gallant
fellow he was, modestly attributed it to some
unnamed lady of his acquaintance.</p>

<p>I came across it quite a little while ago in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
Volume XVI. of my <i>British Essayists</i>. You
know them, those little books bound in
expensive calf with red labels, which nearly
fill a whole bookshelf in the library, and
which you always refuse to open because
you say they look so dull. Well, in No.
101 of <i>The World</i>, dated December 5,
1754, Lord Chesterfield is praising your sex
for the good service it has done to the
English tongue; and I can’t think how he
could! “I never see a pretty mouth opening
to speak,” he says, “but I expect, and
am seldom disappointed, some new improvement
of our language.”</p>

<p>Happy times! Happy man! If only he
could have been here the other day when the
Darkleigh girls called. Their entire vocabulary
consisted of one word, “ripping.” No,
I do them wrong. There was another,
“rag.” And yet what an extremely charming
girl Muriel is, isn’t she? And, after
all, why should a woman be a dictionary?</p>

<p>But to return to Lord Chesterfield. He
goes on to say:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I assisted at the birth of that most
significant word ‘flirtation,’ which dropped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
from the most beautiful mouth in the world,
and which has since received the sanction of
our most accurate Laureate in one of his
comedies. Some inattentive and undiscerning
people have, I know, taken it to be a
term synonymous with coquetry; but I lay
hold of this opportunity to undeceive them,
and eventually to inform Mr Johnson
that flirtation is short of coquetry and
intimates only the first hints of approximation,
which subsequent coquetry may reduce
to those preliminary articles that commonly
end in a definitive treaty.”</p>

</div>

<p>I have quoted Chesterfield merely for the
sake of historic interest, not because his
definition is much to the point just now.
Since his time the word flirtation has changed
its meaning, just as the thing has changed its
character. It means a good deal more
to-day than those “first hints of approximation.”
Flirtation with us does not end
(except by some calamitous accident) in the
“definitive treaty” of marriage. The proof
of which is that when it does we usually say,
or think, “Oh, then it wasn’t a flirtation
after all, it was serious;” implying, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
course, that that which is serious is not
flirtation.</p>

<p>Not but what stupid people among us
misuse the word abominably. You will
sometimes hear a woman accused of flirting
with a man when she has been merely
making herself as delightful as she knows
how to him; doing her simple duty to herself
and to him, that is.</p>

<p>But we need not trouble ourselves, you
and I, as to what stupid people say or think.
We agreed that we wouldn’t, a long time
ago, you remember. I have noticed, too,
that people who say things about us always
are stupid—which is one to us, isn’t it?</p>

<p>No, no, flirtation to-day may go a long way
beyond those first hints of approximation and
still remain flirtation, without reaching those
limits you talk of. It may ... but perhaps
only concrete instances have value in a
discussion of this sort, so let me give you
one. A day or two ago, I went, rather late
in the afternoon, to the Exhibition of Old
Masters now on in Burlington House. I
wish you had been there too; there is
gorgeous Sir Joshua, which you would have
knelt down and worshipped. I should have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
done it myself but for a sense of humour
and a touch of rheumatism in the knee.
Well, in the water-colour gallery I came
upon a man I know and you know, with a
woman I know and so do you. They were
not looking at the drawings, they were sitting
on a seat between two screens. My almost
feminine intuition (don’t jeer) told me that
they had not looked at a picture since they
had passed the turnstile. However, please
understand, Alexa, that there was not the
slightest harm in those two people being
where they were on that afternoon.</p>

<p>At our time of day and amongst our set,
I should hope, any man might go to any
picture gallery with any woman and escape
censure. But the point about these two
people was this. When they saw me, and
saw that I saw them, they seemed embarrassed.
And then the man gave me a look
which meant, if ever a look meant anything,
“I know you’re a decent chap, and I am
confident you will hold your tongue,” and the
lady did not look at me at all, she fidgeted
with the edge of her veil. The veil, by the
way, of course, gave the whole thing away.
It was thickish. People who want to see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
pictures don’t wear thick veils. Now, that
embarrassment, that look of the man’s at me,
that little nervous gesture of the lady’s, told
me that here was a flirtation. Nothing more
than a flirtation so far. I am confident of
that. But a flirtation, mind you, that had
almost reached the limits.</p>

<p>An understanding, a secret understanding,
an understanding from which the rest of the
world is excluded, is of the very essence of
flirtation. The <i>entente</i>, the agreement, may
never have been made by words spoken
in corners, or written in notes, but it must at
least have been made in looks or, no, perhaps
not by anything so definite as they, by the
creation of that most impalpable but most
real thing, an atmosphere, an emotional
atmosphere.</p>

<p>When does a flirtation begin, then? It
begins directly she has succeeded in convincing
him (of course you may reverse the sexes)
that he is more attractive to her than any of
the other men about. Mind, I say in convincing
him. Until he is convinced the
thing has not begun; it is only an attempt
at a flirtation—and to fail in such an attempt
is, with one exception, the most disastrous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
defeat a woman can sustain. No woman
can encounter two beatings of that sort and
retain her self-esteem. Her <i>amour propre</i> is
irreparably ruined. A man, on the other
hand, can survive any number of rebuffs and
come up smiling to face the next; for he can
always comfort himself with the thought
that it was the lady’s prudence and not his
own unattractiveness that was responsible
for the licking.</p>

<p>A flirtation must be without serious intent.
If one of the parties to it have anything
more definite in view, consciously in view,
then he or she is not flirting; it is a one-sided
affair. It is in no way destructive
of the accuracy of my definition that most
affairs are one-sided affairs.</p>

<p>There may be in a flirtation, there nearly
always is, a sort of subtle subconsciousness
of delightful possibilities, of dangerously
delightful possibilities, but that is all there
may be; and it is just these vague possibilities
that give the salt to the dish.</p>

<p>Flirtation then you see, Alexa, is, like
virtue, its own reward. That, I think, is the
only respect in which it does resemble virtue.
Like art, it must exist only for its own sake;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
and it is remarkably like art. Indeed, it
is no inconsiderable part of the art of life.
The object of art, as Pater says somewhere,
is to render radiant, to intensify, our moments.
That and nothing else is the object, so far as
it has an object, of flirtation.</p>

<p>Of course it gratifies our vanity, and of all
gratifications, or nearly all, the gratification
of vanity is the sweetest, the one with least
alloy or unpleasant after-taste. Vanity
suffers from hunger, but never from indigestion,
no, nor from satiety. There are few
things in this world which give a man, who
is a man and not a pudding, such a tingling
thrill of pleasure as the consciousness that a
woman, an ordinarily discreet woman, has
run the ever-so-slightest risk of compromising
herself for his sake.</p>

<p>A woman once told me—quite a nice
woman, Alexa, not a cat, nothing like a cat—that
life’s height was the knowledge that
she could raise a man to the summits or cast
him down to the depths, by giving or withholding
a glance as she left the dinner-table
for the drawing-room. So you see flirtation
has its points as a form of sport.</p>

<p>Obviously then, as I said, there must be an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
understanding, a tacit, if temporary, alliance
between the pair. They must have made a
little circle for themselves, a little circle in
which they two move alone, from which the
rest of the world is excluded, as it were, by a
burning bush. There may be a <i>ménage à trois</i>,
indeed, I am told that the <i>ménage à trois</i> is
one of the commonest of social phenomena,
but a flirtation <i>à trois</i> there can never be. A
woman may flirt with two men, or a man with
two women, but neither of the two must
know of the other’s existence or the thing
falls to pieces.</p>

<p>It is in truth a sort of exercise preliminary
to the duel of sex. The combatants are combatants
only by courtesy; they fence with
the buttons on the foils. So long as the game
is played according to the rules, there is likely
to be naught more seriously discommoding
than a scratch or a tiny little blue bruise which
in a day or two will disappear. But, and here
is the spice of it, at any moment one of the
buttons may come off by accident, or be taken
off by fraud, and then—well, then certainly a
garment may be torn to rags, possibly a heart
may be pierced.</p>

<p>Where does flirtation end? you ask. Well,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
I can tell you where it never ends. It never
ends in a row. Never, at any rate, when he
or she has more brains than a guinea-pig.
Of course, with downright fools there is no
telling. If there be ever so slight a row, ever
so faint a scandal, then there has been something
more than a flirtation. The limits have
been passed; a button, somehow or other,
has come off a foil. When somebody is trying
to get back somebody’s letters somebody has
leaped the limits: be sure of that.</p>

<p>Miss Rhoda Broughton, an author whom
young women of to-day are a little apt
to slight, makes Sarah in <i>Belinda</i> say:—“I
may be a flirt, but thank heaven in the
whole length and breadth of Europe there
exists not a scrap of my handwriting.” Or
words to this effect. May be a flirt forsooth!
Of course she was a flirt, and a flirt of accomplishment,
or she could never truthfully have
made the boast.</p>

<p>But the limits? Well, they are like most
other limits that determine the conduct of
men and women. They are shifting limits,
they change from age to age, and from climate
to climate; nay, more than that, from social
set to social set. Judging from what I hear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
on the top and bottom levels of our present
society there is no fault to find with their
narrowness; and even with us though they
may be not so wide as a church door (horrid
simile that; a church should never even be
thought of in connection with a flirtation)
they will do, they will serve.</p>

<p>Perhaps you want me to be practical though.
Well, here goes then. Secret assignations
should be avoided as beyond the limits, so
should the underground post. You know
what I mean by the underground post; letters
sent to clubs or to post-offices.</p>

<p>Dark corners at dances? Well—yes. A
dark corner may just be inside the boundary,
but a clasped hand in that dark corner is
well over it. But by the way, Alexa, on the
whole it seems not wise in me to set out these
limits for you, because the limits of flirtation
are also the perilous edges of—find the word for
me in the <i>Thesaurus</i>. There is plenty of room
well within those limits for you to entertain
yourself, and others, in security. Keep away
from the limits, for, as I said, they are vague,
apt sometimes, in emotional moments, to
become blurred, invisible even perhaps. When
a girl of your tender years gets near to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
limits she is likely to call for the prompt
and most disagreeable intervention of a, and
particularly of</p>

<h3>MEN’S LOVE</h3>

</div>

<p class="right"><i>Jan. 20, 19—.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My dear Alexa</span>,—</p>

<p class="indent8">Your appetite for knowledge does you
credit. It is inherited, doubtless. And
how comprehensive it is! You wish
you knew all about men, do you? A
moderate wish; a wish that if realised would
make you empress of the world. Yes, that
and nothing less than that is the destiny of
the woman, when she arrives, who knows all
about men. We shall not see her just yet
though, and when, if ever we do, then, as
Swinburne’s distressful lover says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Content you, I shall not be there.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So as things are I sleep peacefully o’ nights.
That masterful lady does not even trouble
my dreams.</p>

<p>Don’t you know, child, that men are now,
and always have been, combined in a conspiracy
not to let women know all about
them; nay, more than that, to permit women<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
to know as little as possible? Men are not
very clever in other ways, but they are, I
fancy, clever enough to make that particular
conspiracy a success. They have done very
well so far, anyhow.</p>

<p>Women know curiously little about men;
curiously little considering the long time they
have had to study the subject, and how
greatly it has always been to their interest to
know as much as possible. Take women
novelists, for instance—not the silly sort, but
the very best of them, the giantesses of
fiction—Georges Sand, George Eliot, Charlotte
Brontë—to say nothing of the second
string, the women writers of our day, the Mrs
Craigies, the Ouidas, the Mrs Humphrey
Wardses. Why is it, by the way, that when
there was no “Woman Movement” there
were great women artists, and that now when
woman is clamorous and obtrusive there are
none?</p>

<p>But take, as I said, the big women. Scarce
one of them has presented us with a real live
man. Think of Charlotte Brontë’s Rochester!
George Eliot did better. Just now and then
some of her men do really think and feel as
men feel and think. But that, I suggest,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
was because George Eliot was herself something
more or less than a woman. The men
in women’s novels, it is true, act as men act,
but they rarely or never think as men think.
Women are keenly observant; they see what
men do; they don’t know, because men never
tell them, what men think.</p>

<p>Now please don’t make, even in your own
mind, the obvious and inept reply, “Neither
do men know women,” because by the universal
consent of women themselves the great
men novelists, and some of the small ones,
have portrayed veritable women; Balzac, for
example, and George Meredith, and Thomas
Hardy and Flaubert! Was there ever a
realer woman than Madame Bovary?—I am
not sure, though, that you have made her
acquaintance.</p>

<p>The concealment, conscious and unconscious,
begins almost at the beginning. The
smallest schoolboy never lets his sisters see
him as he sees himself and as he is seen of
his fellows. To his sisters he talks a different
language even, a different language from
the language of the playground, I mean.
And it is well for him that he does. If he
didn’t, and his father caught him at it, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
would be sorrow and soreness for that boy.
No novelist, man or woman, has so much
as begun to depict the schoolboy as he is.
Kipling is nowhere near it, nor Eden
Phillpotts, nor the rest. And as for Tom
Brown...!</p>

<p>No, not only do women not know men,
but they don’t even know boys, and that
really is queer, because women themselves
are curiously like boys in many ways, and,
after all, they do have a good deal to do
with the bringing up of boys. But it is
wonderful how much a boy manages to hide
even from his mother. I don’t think he
does it consciously; it is the inherited
instinct of his sex—the result of natural
selection, probably—explainable on Darwinian
principles, like most else in this
world.</p>

<p>You see, for you know your Darwin, if
a man were to let women know all about
him no decently civilised woman would ever
be found so fond or so foolish as to mate with
him. Consequently he would never reproduce
his kind—he would not be the fittest
and would not survive.</p>

<p>Rum, isn’t it? I have only just thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
of it, but I am quite sure it is a discovery
of vast importance—that the continuance of
the race depends upon women’s ignorance
of men.</p>

<p>Let me give you an example of their
colossal ignorance of boys. Mrs Bates was
here the other day. You know she is an
exceptionally intelligent woman, and really
learned also. She had been reading some
Italian psychologist’s book on Love; and,
judging from what she told me, that
foreigner really appears to have known
something about it. It seems he gave a
case of a lad of fourteen who had a passion
for a lady of thirty or thereabouts. And
Mrs Bates asked me if such a thing were
possible! I enlightened her with frankness
and great wealth of detail. But I could see
she didn’t believe me; she thought I was
talking through my hat all the time; inventing
as I went on.</p>

<p>I don’t ask you, Alexa, whence comes
this new-born desire of yours to know all
about men; but I warn you that I am
pretty good at guessing. However, let
that pass. Not only will you never know
all about men, but at present, my kiddie,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
you don’t know anything at all. Knowledge
of live things is not to be got from books
or plays. All you can get from books or
plays is—what shall I call it? there is no
one word that will do—a sort of vague and
deceptive hint of the reality. That is not
very well put, but it is the best I can do
for the moment. Knowledge of life means
knowledge of men and women, just that
and naught but that, and knowledge of life
can only be got by living. You can learn
no more of it from books than you could
learn of a country by merely studying a
map. You would, of course, learn more of
it in five minutes from some intelligent and
talkative traveller who had been there, and
who chatted freely.</p>

<p>Well, your father is such a traveller, and
he has made a longish journey through the
territory of life, a territory in which he has
looked about him with the eyes of a man.
Even so, he can’t do much for his daughter,
but he can do something, he has done something,
and he will do more if time be
granted him.</p>

<p>Bear in mind, then, when you read of
love, the love of the sexes, when you hear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
it talked about, when you see it, apparently
going on under your eyes, that this traveller
towards the end of his journeyings often
catches himself doubting whether there is
such a thing as <i>love</i> of the sexes at all,
whether, in short, to call the thing
“love” is not to do an outrage to language
and to common sense.</p>

<p>Of course, you can call any thing by any
name you like, but you have no sort of
right to call two widely and fundamentally
different things by the same name. And
to call the emotion I have for you, for
instance, by the same name as you call the
emotion a man experiences for a woman
when he is “in love” with her is monstrous.
The two things are dissimilar in almost
every respect.</p>

<p>When a man and woman are infected by
what some scientific French gentleman
seriously declares to be the love-microbe
they are, it seems to me, the victims of all
sorts of curious delusions and illusions, and
they are unable to analyse their own states of
mind. The man feels capable of all sorts of
heroism and nobility, and the woman of any
amount of self-sacrifice. That feeling of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
theirs is sheer delusion. In point of fact
they are both in a state of highly inflamed
egoism. Introduce the slightest whiff of
jealousy and the heroism and the self-sacrifice
are converted into the lowest-down sort of
meanness. At once you get base and baseless
suspicions, spying, of the opening-letters
and listening-outside-doors order, and often,
to wind up with, cruelty and savagery more
frightful than the beast’s.</p>

<p>Well now, is the thing, this in-loveness
which can be so easily transformed into
devilry, worthy of the name we give to the
feeling of parents for children, or friends
towards one another? Yet that first thing
is what is meant when one talks of the love
of the sexes!</p>

<p>Mind you, there is no avoiding that
microbe, the anti-toxin has not yet been
found, and I don’t mind predicting that if
ever it be found the demand for it will be of
the slackest. I don’t mind confessing that
if that microbe were swept out of the world,
as we hope some day to sweep out the
tubercle bacillus, the little chap would leave
the world considerably duller than he found
it, so dull as to be no place for the likes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
me. But still we may as well see the thing
for what it is. Because we are all mad
sometimes, and enjoy our brief deliriums,
there is no reason why in the sane intervals
we should not frankly recognise what we
were the last time we went mad and what
we are likely to be the next.</p>

<p>Please don’t imagine that I have written the
above passage by way of a warning to you.
The philosopher neither warns against the
inevitable nor regrets it. He likes just to
look it straight in the face sometimes, that’s
all. It amuses him.</p>

<p>But now, apart from this in-loveness—which
I will not call love, hang me if I will—do
men, men as a whole, men as a sex,
love women, women in the lump, women as
a sex? As I live, I don’t believe they do!
It would be interesting if some leisured and
industrious person—you might take on the
job, Alexa, when you return—would compile
a volume of proverbs, aphorisms, epigrams,
from all languages, which have women as
their subject. There is scarcely one of them—I
don’t remember one—that has a word to
say in her praise. As Dick Phenyl used to
say in <i>Sweet Lavender</i>, ... ah heaven!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
a senile shudder runs through me when I
think what a long time ago that was—“it’s all
blame, blame, nothing but blame,” and a
good deal more than blame, heavy vituperation,
acrid snarling, and, I freely admit it,
often disgusting and mendacious slander.
But still, there we are; men made these
proverbs and aphorisms, men cut and polished
these epigrams, and men have kept them as
current coin in the world.</p>

<p>Now I put it to you, does one satirise,
ironise, slate, bully-rag, and squirt verbal
vitriol at the thing one loves?</p>

<p>Then, watch men. You have the opportunity,
since I understand you have a full
house just now. Watch them, then. Do
they, for instance, hurry up to the drawing-room
after dinner, or do they linger down
there over their wine and their talk till the
hostess loses her patience and every feminine
eye keeps turning to the door? No doubt
if there’s any man there hopelessly “in love”
he would sneak up if he dared. But the
others? And oh! if you were to see us the
moment after the dining-room door has
closed behind you, you dears! If you were
to see how we draw our chairs up, to note<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
the change in our voices, the air of comfort
with which we finger our glasses, the heavy
reluctance with which we rise when the host
gives the word! Oh!</p>

<p>I suppose there’s a little shooting still
going on, isn’t there, or is it all over? But
if there is, I dare say some of the women go
out with the guns, or at any rate meet the
men for luncheon. Well, watch the men’s
faces, watch closely (don’t listen to their
voices, we know how to school our voices)
when the women volunteer. You will see
how men pant for “women’s society!”</p>

<p>They won’t have you in their clubs, Alexa;
think of that. Some years ago I, greatly
daring, did propose at the annual general
meeting of my club that women should be
admitted—to tea. I could not find a
seconder. One old gentleman who, to my
great surprise, did rise to second me turned
out to be deaf, and thought I was proposing
something quite different. That luckless
attempt of mine almost ruined my reputation;
the memory of it still clings to me
like the traces of some fell disease. They
thought I was, well—pretty much everything
but what I am.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>And yet how polite and altogether nice
men are to you, aren’t they? How promptly
they spring forward to take the lightest
parcel from your hand, with what lackey-like
deference do they hold open the door that
you may pass out! Yes, but then you are a
woman, a pretty and attractive woman of
their own social standing. Again I say,
watch. Do they show quite the same
alacrity in the case of a less delightful or
of a much older woman than you? Still
further, do they show any disposition at all
to carry the coal-box upstairs for the housemaid—and
the housemaid, after all, is a
woman, you know.</p>

<p>No; men do not love women. Or, if
they love them they love them as the hawk
loves the pigeon, or as you love chocolate
almonds. Men, as men, do not, I repeat,
love women as women; but I love you, and
I am always</p>

<h3>THE MAN’S POINT OF VIEW</h3>

</div>

<p class="right"><i>Feb. 9, 19—.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My dear Alexa</span>,—</p>

<p class="indent8">No—that formal greeting inadequately
expresses my emotion at the moment—I will
say then, Alexa dearest—</p>

<p>I am really sorry that my last letter should
have put you into such a flutter; should
have ruffled your mind’s plumage so quite
unduly. I find I nearly always do come to
grief in this way when I neglect the advice
given me years and years ago by a wise and
wicked old man, when I was a foolish and a
passably good young one.</p>

<p>“My boy,” that old rapscallion said—he
was holding up a glass of his own port to the
candle when he said it, and enjoying the
delight of the eye previous to the pleasure of
the palate. “My boy, never tell the truth
to women. You’ll find it infernally difficult
to do any way, and it always turns out badly.”
He gave me much other counsel of a similar
sort. Sometimes I have acted upon it and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
sometimes I have not. When I have I have
always scored handsomely; when I haven’t
I have invariably been sorry for myself.</p>

<p>He was a remarkable old gentleman, old
Gillion. He enjoyed the worst reputation
of any man of his set. When I say enjoyed
I mean enjoyed. He loved it; he cherished
it as a collector of books cherishes his rare
old editions. He died at the age of eighty-seven
in an odour of diabolism, tenderly
served and waited upon by a troop of affectionate
and expectant grandchildren, to whom
he left not a penny. Years before he had
invested all his money in an annuity. But
they didn’t know that. They say he died
with a smile on his lips. I can quite believe
it. He always loved irony.</p>

<p>It is, as that sage reprobate said, infernally
difficult to tell the truth to women, and that,
I make no doubt, is why it so seldom gets
told. For one thing the truth, the bare
truth, is nearly always unpleasant, and so you
see, the temptation to lie attacks us on our
softer, our more kindly, side. I am quite
sure that nine times out of ten when men
deceive women they do it much less for their
own sakes than for the sakes of the women.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
Now, don’t raise your eyebrows and draw
down your lip-corners, because that really is
so. Moreover, they often feel (if they be of
a philosophic cast they know) that the deception
comes nearer to the truth than the actual
bald fact would be. Bald facts are seldom
or never true facts. Truth is ever a thing
of atmosphere, of light and shade, of fine gradations.
Truth is a point of view, sometimes
a very temporary and transient point of view.</p>

<p>A point of view. Yes, that’s it. And
that is why it is not only difficult but, I
incline to think, impossible for men to tell
the truth to women. Suppose you have two
persons whose eyes are so constructed that
they can only see the world through glasses,
and suppose one of these persons is doomed
always to wear green glasses and the other
pink glasses. How on earth can any object
ever look the same to both? A can tell B
that a sheet of paper is green, but he may
say so for ever, and yet B will always see it
pink. And the fun of the thing is that it is
really white all the time! And what do I
mean by “really”? I don’t know.</p>

<p>But are men and women so different as all
that, you will be asking yourself. Yes, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
are. Quite as different as all that, and more
so. They are wonderfully different. The
longer I live and the more I look about me
the greater and more distinct do the differences
seem to become. I know it’s the
fashion just now, especially among strong
women and weak men, to deny this, and to
declare that as we evolve we grow nearer to,
more like, each other. Sheer nonsense, my
dear, sheer nonsense!</p>

<p>One of the most notable marks of civilisation
is the way in which it differentiates the
sexes. A savage father is much nearer to his
daughter than I am to you. I am rather
sorry for it, but it can’t be helped, and this
letter of yours goes some way towards
proving it. And yet I don’t know that I
am quite honest in saying that I am sorry for
it—another instance of how difficult it is to
tell the truth, you see—for it seems to me
that a good deal of the joy, or at any rate of
the excitement, of life is brought about by
just that difference. Life has little that is
exciting to your civilised man, and if you
deprive him of that...!</p>

<p>But to come to your letter. You say that
I picture the world to you, the world of men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
and women, as a place full of ravening beasts
of prey, and you add that now whenever two
or three men are fluffing round you, you will
feel like a defenceless pigeon surrounded by
hungry hawks. Well, if my letter has done
that for you it must have wrought a transformation
indeed. I have seen you more
than once with two or three young men fluffing
(I like that word fluffing, it is apt; keep it
for future use) round you and somehow it
never struck me that they in the faintest
degree resembled hawks or that there was anything
of the silly pigeon about my daughter.
They generally, I seem to remember, looked
nervous and rather scared, though genuinely
anxious to please, very unhawk like; but
then they were young, and I dare say a callow
hawk is pretty well as timid as a newly hatched
chick. Courage comes with age, with the
hardening of the beak and the sharpening of
the talons.</p>

<p>Yet I am not altogether sorry if my last
letter brought to you some realisation of some
part of the truth; one aspect of it, let us say.
Looked at from one point of view, the world
of men and women is full of ravening beasts
of prey. But take up another standpoint and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
you will see that the powers and opportunities
of the beasts are often pretty narrowly limited.
Limited sometimes by their own ignorance of
their own powers, limited always by the social
institutions which they themselves have established.
It seems rum, but the wolf has filed his
own fangs, the hawk has clipped his own claws.</p>

<p>You may be a pigeon, Alexa, but, thanks
to many things, you are not a defenceless
pigeon. You are defended, for instance, by
your own brains, by the knowledge which I
have taken good care should be yours, by the
customs of the social circle in which you were
born, by the institution of marriage, and most
of all by the jealousy and suspicion the wolves
and hawks have of one another. So on the
whole you are tolerably safe, my birdie; you
need not flutter a feather. Remember what
I once told you in another letter when I was
employing a slightly different set of metaphors—it
is always the traitor in the citadel who
gives the fortress away.</p>

<p>“If men don’t really love women, women
as a sex, as distinguished from their own
particular women,” you ask, “why is it that
they protect them to such an extent, to such a
so often unnecessary and troublesome extent?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
Why do they always rescue them first in shipwrecks
and fires, and so on?”</p>

<p>Curiously enough, that was almost exactly
the question your friend Stella put to me only
yesterday when she called here at tea time and
everybody but I was out.</p>

<p>By the way, what a ferociously advanced
young woman Stella is becoming! She quite
scared me now and then. I never felt at all
sure what she was going to say next. She
was in a great rage with one of her young
men cousins who had taken her to the theatre
the night before, or the night before that. I
forget for the moment what the play was, but
it doesn’t matter. She liked it and was
intensely interested in it, but the young man
violently disapproved of it—disapproved of
it for her, that is. Half way through the
second act he insisted on her leaving the
theatre there and then. Stella made a fight
of it, but she couldn’t make a scene, and so
she caved in, and now she swears she will
never speak to him again.</p>

<p>The reason he gave her was that he could
not bear the idea of his cousin (“<i>his</i> cousin,”
you should have heard Stella emphasise the
possessive) listening to such a grossly improper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
thing as that. Stella’s very pretty
face wrinkled with wrath when she told me.
“<i>His</i> cousin,” she repeated. “As though I
were his property. But that’s always the
way with men. The man’s point of view!
How I hate it! They can’t bear that anything
of which they disapprove should come near
any woman connected with them. They
don’t mind about the others.”</p>

<p>And so, quite against my own will, I was
compelled—the while I soothed her with
chocolates—to defend, or rather to explain
(it comes to the same thing) the Man’s Point
of View. My explanation will go some way
to answering you.</p>

<p>Stella was right in one thing. She put her
finger—what beautiful hands the girl has, by
the way, did you ever notice them?—directly
on the spot. It is the sense of proprietorship
that does it. Men do not love women as
women, but they do love, or at any rate have
some sort of feeling which serves the purpose
of love, their own women kind, the women
“connected with them.” There is nothing a
bit noble in it to begin with, it is just sheer
egoism; the same sort of feeling that makes
a child before it can talk hold on tight to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
toy that you try to take away from it. I
remember you, when you were in your cradle,
punched me with one fist while you clung on
with the other to a woolly red ball that you
would cram into your mouth. Well, just so,
but more effectively would I punch a man
who tried to take you away from me. And
at the root the motive for the punching would
be the same. So, Alexa, unless the man be
quite of the right sort let him look to himself,
for I still keep my punching muscles in trim.</p>

<p>No, in this sense of ownership there is
nothing noble, nothing magnificent, nothing
to swagger about. But just as a very lovely
and exquisite flower may have a very dirty
and ugly root, so from this sense of ownership
has grown the fine flower of chivalry
and the less fine and flowerlike but, for work-a-day
purposes, the much more useful plant
of men’s protective attitude to all women, or,
not to exaggerate, to a good many women.</p>

<p>It is sometimes inconvenient to the women
concerned, no doubt, as it was the other
night to Stella; but it is thanks to it that
they have any sort of a time in the world.
That feeling of proprietorship which a man
concentrates on his own women folk he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
extends in a diluted and attenuated form to
the women of his own class, and in a form
still more attenuated (sometimes very thin
indeed) to all women. Roughly put it
amounts to this, that each man is ready to
protect any woman against any other man.
There are occasions, spite of the proverb to
the contrary, when hawks do peck out other
hawks’ eyes.</p>

<p>So you see on the whole it is a little ungrateful
to grumble at the Man’s Point of
View, isn’t it?</p>

<p>I think I said a page or two back that one
of your defences was the institution of
marriage. Perhaps, lest you should think I
was talking mere conventional rubbish, I had
better explain what I meant.</p>

<p>Men are not cowards; lots of them love
and choose danger for its own sake. Bernard
Shaw is quite wrong when he says in one of
his plays that fear is the greatest of all human
forces. That remark is only a little feat of
intellectual gymnastics, designed to startle.
But, valiant and daring blades though men
are, there is one thing that they fear with a
craven, shrinking, shivering terror. That
thing is marriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>“They marry!” you reply. Why, yes,
and so also do they die, though often with
somewhat less reluctance; and they marry
just as they die, because they can’t help themselves.
The impulse to marriage (as things
are) is as irresistible as the spear-thrust of
Death. It would be interesting if in the
vestry after the ceremony one could apply
some species of Chinese torture to every
bridegroom and extort from him the truth
as to whether he did indeed want to marry
this woman. He wanted this woman, of
course, but did he want, actually want, to
take upon himself the life-long responsibilities,
the life-long expenses, the life-long
risks, the life-long limitation of liberty?</p>

<p>Why the fact, this deep aversion of the
man from marriage, this recoil from the altar,
is marked in common speech, and anything
that is marked in common speech “is so,” as
the Americans say. Don’t you often hear it
said that Miss So-and-So has “caught,”
“hooked,” “captured,” young Thingamy?
When do you ever hear that a man has
caught, hooked, or captured (in a matrimonial
sense) a woman?</p>

<p>The institution of marriage is the highest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
and the stoutest barrier between the sexes
that society has ever set up. That is not
a paradox. It is a plain, almost an obvious
truth. Thus the pigeon (poor little pigeon!)
escapes many attacks from the hawks without
the trouble of moving a wing. In other
words, a woman meets with far fewer advances,
much less pursuit, and consequently
much less temptation, from men than she
would were it not for this institution of
marriage. The boldest and most hungry
hawk thinks twice before swooping on the
pigeon if he knows that the pigeon, harmless
as she looks, may turn and manacle him to
her for the rest of his natural life, before he
knows where he is.</p>

<p>And so, Alexa, if you sometimes feel that
fewer young men fluff around you than your
many attractions might warrant, don’t be depressed
or self-distrustful. It is not because
you are not pretty or fascinating enough; it
is because they are afraid you might marry
them. Their self-restraint is really the
highest compliment they can pay you.</p>

<p>Good-bye, and don’t be offended with your
truth-loving</p>

<h3>THE DOMESTIC HEARTH</h3>

</div>

<p class="right"><i>March 1, 19—.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My dear Alexa</span>,—</p>

<p class="indent8">If you have a fault—and far be it
from your adoring father to suggest that
you have—but if you have a fault, it shows
itself in your trick of asking questions
beginning with an “ought.” I think my recollection
is right when it tells me that your
last three letters have, together with a good
deal that was both interesting and diverting,
contained a query as to whether you or somebody
else “ought” or “ought” not to do
something or other. When it is a case of
You, I feel myself more or less competent to
answer; for about You I do know a little,
you see; but when you ask me what somebody
else ought to do or to leave undone,
somebody else of whom I know nothing, why,
then I am stricken with a feeling of hopeless
futility. I sit here and dither, and cover
sheets of letter paper with my illegible handwriting
only to tear them up after a miserable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
half-hour’s boggling. For to know what a
person “ought” to do, one must know the
person, you see, and the circumstances in
which that person is posed. There are no
“oughts” unrelated to particular persons and
particular circumstances. If there were, what
plain sailing life’s perilous voyage would be,
wouldn’t it? In point of dismal fact that
voyage is made upon an uncharted sea. A
few plain general instructions in the principles
of navigation are all we get; we have to look
out for the rocks and shoals and whirlpools
and adverse currents for ourselves.</p>

<p>There are not nearly so many “oughts” in
life as you in the solemn ingenuousness of
your youth doubtless imagine. As you grow
older you will find the “oughts” diminish
and the “musts” increase. That is to say
what looks like moral freedom gradually, and
not so very gradually either, gives way to
what in stern fact is practical necessity. But
I suppose I must come to the point.</p>

<p>“Ought girls to earn their own livings?”
you ask in a postscript, which I can’t help
wishing you had forgotten to add. There is
no dodging a postscript, there is no pretending
one hasn’t noticed it. That is perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
why women are so fond of it. But—no
longer to dodge yours—see how the facts of
life limit the scope of your question. See
how your “ought” is, for the vast majority
of young women, at once converted into a
“must.” For the vast majority of young
women the question does not so much as
arise. They do earn their own livings as it
is, and they do it not because they ought or
because they choose, but just because they
must. The housemaid, for instance, who
made your bed this morning, and who, I hope,
dusted and put straight your room—a lengthy
business, Alexa, for I know your ways—do
you suppose that her action was the outcome
of any moral questionings or of personal predilection?
Do you suppose she did it from
a high sense of duty, because she felt that
something would go askew with the universe
or with her own soul if she left it undone?
Of course she didn’t. She did it because
she had to do it, to do either that or something
just a trifle more objectionable, on the
whole. She is probably one of a large and
poor family, and as soon as she had passed
the Sixth Standard, or whatever it is which
the law of her country demands that she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
should pass, she had to go out to service.
There was no “ought” about it. And those
young women whom you saw in Fleet Street,
at mid-day, when you were there with me,
you remember, a day or two before you left
home, and whose behaviour struck you as
being so vulgar and objectionable! They
were binders’ girls; they had already been
working several hours in a stuffy atmosphere,
and after a quarter-of-an-hour’s rollicking up
and down Fleet Street, they were about to
return and work several more hours. And
do you think that they had decided to do
all that work after mature deliberation as to
the rights and wrongs of it? Of course they
hadn’t. It was for them that, or something
infinitely worse than that, and so they chose,
if they can be said to choose, that. It was
a case of “must,” not of “ought.” And
when a thing must be, there is no more reckless
waste of honest time possible than that
spent in discussing whether it ought to be.</p>

<p>Your question applies then, you see, only
to a very limited number of young women.
It was not a thoughtfully-framed question,
Alexa. It was, if you will forgive me, a
middle-class sort of question. When you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
wrote “girls,” you were thinking of yourself
and of young women in a social position
similar to yours, and they are rather a small
minority of the earth’s inhabitants; delightful,
but few, comparatively. So let me frame the
question for you as you would have framed
it if you had thought a little more about it,
and then let’s get to work upon it.</p>

<p>What you meant to ask was, I think, this:
Ought a young woman of good education,
ordinary health, stature, and capacity (whose
parents can afford to keep her in idleness) to
live upon their income until such time as she
is asked by a nice young gentleman to come
and live upon his? That is about as near as
we can get to it, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Well, even that very limited interrogative
proposition is not altogether easy to tackle.
One question leads always directly or indirectly
to another, and so we go on asking
“Why?” until we come flat up against a
dead wall before which we can do nothing but
gibber. In the affairs of practical life it is
necessary to treat some matters as settled,
and one of such matters is this:—If you
receive from a person services for which you
make no return, you are under an obligation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
to that person; and to sit quiescent under
an obligation, to make no effort to get out
of it, is to suffer humiliation and indignity.
That, reasonably or unreasonably, is the view
of every decently honest man and woman, of
every man and woman whose hand you
would care to take in friendship. That is
your own view, Alexa, when you come to
think of it, isn’t it? I have noticed that
whenever a friend makes you a present you
begin to cast about for some way in which
you can make some return without doing it
too obviously. Moreover, you would not
accept a present at all from one who was not
a friend. If one of your fellow-guests now,
for instance, were to offer you a diamond
bracelet, you would be in no end of a rage,
and would probably write to me.</p>

<p>Now then, everybody of full age and
capacity who is eating, drinking, dwelling in
a house and wearing clothes, and yet doing
nothing whatever to provide that food, drink,
house and apparel, is suffering that humiliation
and indignity of which we have just
spoken. He may not be conscious of it.
Obviously he is not (for there are many
millions of him) conscious of it, but the fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
remains. There is just one reply he can
make to the charge. He can say, if he likes,
“Oh, it is true I do nothing practical,
material, in return for the many services
which are done for me; but I consent to live.
I exist beautifully. I look nice, I talk, when
I take the trouble to talk, quite prettily. I
wear my clothes with an air. I am an
example of what a human being should be.
Thus, by merely being, do I recompense the
world for all the trouble it takes for me.” If
he does say that, then I for my part can think
of no adequate rejoinder. If it be a man
who talks like that, one kicks him and takes
the consequences; if a woman, one (perhaps)
kisses her and drops the controversy.</p>

<p>But that tiresome “ought” of yours
which I feel buzzing round my head as I
write, like a bee, and a bee with a sting, too!
To deal with it properly I must assume
something to start with, and so here goes.
I assume this: One <span class="smcap">ought</span> to do that
which will enable one to live the happiest
life attainable in one’s circumstances and to
develop one’s capabilities to their fullest. I
assume that, and if you query it, Alexa, I
will wait until you return home and have a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
couple of hours’ <i>tête-à-tête</i> with you in my
study.</p>

<p>Now then, does a grown-up young woman
live the happiest life attainable or develop
her natural capacities to their fullest while
she lives in her parents’ house, dependent for
every penny she spends upon her parents’
bounty or caprice, acting under her parents’
orders in all the great and in the most of the
smaller doings of her life, and subject to her
parents’ rules, regulations, and discipline?</p>

<p>Judging from my own observation and
knowledge of the way in which human nature
is composed I haven’t the smallest hesitation
in answering “No.” My observation tells me
that there may be outward acquiescence, my
penetration tells me no less surely that there
is always hidden resentment. A thwarted
desire for freedom works like poison in the
blood; in the long run it sours the finest
temper. It gives birth to a fire which,
though it may never flame, continually
smoulders; and, remember, this desire for
freedom, for the power to do what we will,
to go where we wish, to say what we like,
subject always to the limitations of external
circumstances, is inherent in every human<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
breast. The restrictions of external circumstances
we most of us accept without over
much of rancour. What we do not accept,
that against which we are in eternal revolt,
is the restriction imposed upon us by other
wills than ours. That impulsive desire to
break away from pupillage, to strike out
“on our own,” is perhaps of all motives the
most legitimate that can stir the human
soul.</p>

<p>The Home as we so often know it, the
Home which consists of father, mother,
and grown-up dependent sons or daughters,
or both, is not a place wherein such impulses
and motives can rightly develop or have anything
like free play. Such a Home is
necessarily and inevitably a tyranny; at best
a benevolent tyranny, at worst a tyranny in
which benevolence is far to seek. Don’t
imagine that I have joined the cult of Mr
Bernard Shaw and am about to say anything
so ridiculously untrue as that the Home is
the very worst institution in which to bring
up a child, except the school. That is a mere
paradox of Nihilism distraught. The Home,
so far, is the best of all institutions in which
to bring up a child—to <i>bring up a child</i>, mark,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
not to support a grown man or woman. It
has its analogy in the nests of birds and the
lairs of beasts; but Nature, for once in a
way, is wiser than modern man. The young
bird leaves the nest as soon as it is strong
enough on the wing; the young tiger says
good-bye to the lair on the day on which he
can kill his own prey. The Home of grown-up
sons and daughters who are not earning
their own livings—even the happiest of such
Homes—is a place of continual and constant
compromise and surrender, of suppression, of
restraint, of concealed (and not always concealed)
resentments and silent rebellions.
Just now and then maybe (for I want to
avoid extremes) it may draw forth the best
that is in us; but much more often it evokes
the worst. It narrows even when it does not
actually distort; it cripples even when it
does not actually slay. And there is no help
for it, Alexa. The profoundest wisdom, the
sincerest love, can do little more than slightly
ameliorate the essential, the immutable wrongness
of the Thing, the subjection of adult will
to adult will. Children of no matter what
age who are dependent upon their parents
economically, must needs be dependent in all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
else. The world is so constructed that he
who pays the piper calls the tune. And it is
well; for even worse than an ordered tyranny
is an anarchic republic.</p>

<p>There is just another point. Marriages,
Alexa, are not made in Heaven as some are
still found to say, nor in Hell, as too many
just now are apt to declare. They are made
for the most part in the Home. The
strongest condemnation of the grown-up
Home is the enormous number of young
women who marry to get away from it. In
the name of my own sex I do resent and
protest against that. It is hard upon us that
we should be so often regarded by the Beloved
as a sort of melancholy alternative to the
Home. Girls, in our class at any rate, marry
much more often with a view to being their
own mistresses, as we say, than to being men’s
wives or children’s mothers. And I sometimes
fancy they are under no very serious
illusions as to the radiant possibilities of the
married state, these marrying maidens of
ours. There was once a man, you know,
who after several days’ suffering from acute
earache went out and had a tooth drawn.
When he was asked why he supposed that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
extraction of a sound tooth would remedy
the agony of an unsound ear, he replied that
he had never supposed anything of the kind.
All he wanted was to change the pain, and
that the dentist had done for him! A
similar desire, I am sure, will alone account
for some recent marriages of your young
friends which have caused you so much
puzzlement. “I cannot make out what she
saw in him,” you have more than once
remarked to me. Well, she saw just that—a
change in the pain. Not nice for him, is
it? Nor so very nice for her.</p>

<p>And now I wonder whether you consider
that I have answered your question at all
satisfactorily. I daresay not, for this world
is a welter, and the wisest of us is bemazed
with doubts. It is possible to have doubts
about everything—at least I should say about
everything but one, and that is that I am
always, my own kiddie,</p>

<h3>THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE</h3>

</div>

<p class="right"><i>April 2, 19—.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My dear Alexa</span>,—</p>

<p class="indent8">The question put in the last paragraph
of your last letter, to which I have
perhaps been a little overlong in replying, is
one which I should have thought I had
already answered, answered, too, in the only
way in which such questions can be answered
satisfactorily—by actual practice. You know
me well enough, I take it, to know that, like
every other decently-honest man, when I
have a conviction I act upon it. Mind, I
say a conviction, not a mere opinion. Mere
opinions, when they differ widely from the
opinions held by those around us, we often
do wisely to keep to ourselves. But convictions
are of another stuff. When we have
them (and we don’t have very many of them as
a rule) we must out with them, both in word
and deed, or we perish. Concealed convictions
set up in the soul a moral and intellectual
rot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>Well, now, you ask me, or seem to ask
me, what are my views as to the amount of
censorship that should be exercised over the
reading of young women. That, I gather,
was your particular point. More generally
you seem to inquire what fruit of the tree of
knowledge should still be forbidden to those
of your sex after that cardinal day when they
have put their hair up and let their skirts
down.</p>

<p>Now, for once in a way, I yield to the
temptation to reply by the stale rhetorical
device of asking another question. What
has been my practice with you, child—a
practice deliberately adopted and resolutely
persevered in, spite of the remonstrances of
some who had every right to remonstrate,
and of others who had none? Ever since
you were sixteen or thereabouts—I don’t
remember at what age exactly it was that you
began to show unmistakable proofs of
marked and hereditary (don’t smile!) intelligence—have
you not had a free run of my
library? A library, by the way, in which
there is only one locked book-case, and
that case kept locked, not because of the
dangerous character of the contents, but on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
account of the expensive nature of the bindings.
What happened when—but I won’t
go on with these tiresome interrogatives.
I will just recall to your memory what
happened now and then when I saw in your
hands a book about which, to express indefinitely
my indefinite state of mind, I had
my doubts. I just looked up from my table
and said, “If I were you, I wouldn’t read
that: it is rather dull and rather nasty”; or,
“The only points about that book that have
any merit are points you wouldn’t understand,”
and, like the sensible girl you always
were, you invariably put the books back in
their shelves again. But I was not always in
the library when you came there in search of
literary refreshment, and once, only once, I
remember I came upon you deep in a book
about which I had no doubts at all. I
noticed that you were rather more than half-way
through it, and that you looked interested,
though a little puzzled too. “Do
you like that book?” I asked. “No—yes—perhaps—I
don’t know—a little,” you
stammered, and you blushed. Now, a blush
does not in the least imply consciousness of
guilt, or even of offence, as is commonly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
supposed. People blush not when they find
themselves in the prisoner’s dock, but, rather,
when they are in a tight corner; more often
still when they believe themselves to be
suspected of something of which they are
entirely innocent. When you have to deal
with a child, Alexa, and you accuse it of, or
question it concerning, some little delinquency,
don’t, should it stammer and blush, leap to
the conclusion that it is guilty. But this is
by the way. “Don’t you wish me to read
this book; shall I put it back?” you asked.
“Oh, you had better finish it,” I said, and
turned away to my work. I did not explain
to you then, but I tell you now, because it
has a definite bearing on the subject in hand,
that I knew that, having already got half-way
through it, your interest was awakened and
your curiosity excited, and I knew that in a
young woman or in a young man either, for
the matter of that, excited or only half-gratified
curiosity is—well, I can’t use too
strong a term, so I will say, the very devil—the
most devilish of all the legion of devils
that beset the path of youth. I felt sure,
too, that if I forbade you the reading of the
second half of that book you would attach<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
undue importance to what you had learned
from the first half. You would see the
thing—the evil thing, let us frankly call it—exaggerated
out of all true proportion. You
would conceive it to be worse than it really
was, you would believe that it played a
greater part in life than as a fact it does.
Moreover, I did not feel sure—for you were,
thank God, a very human girl, that you
would not come back to that book when I
was not there, and finish it in private, and
thus do your own soul a thousand times more
harm by the deception than any undesirable
knowledge you might acquire could possibly
do you.</p>

<p>You tell me that your question to me arose
out of a discussion which took place a few
nights ago between your host, your fellow-guests,
and yourself: that it began an hour
after dinner and lasted well away beyond the
usual bed-time. Let me congratulate you,
Alexa, on staying with such sensible people
as the Mauleverers, and on being one of
several guests as intelligent as yourself. By
“sensible people” I mean people who are
able, and who like, to talk after dinner for
more than five consecutive minutes on any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
subject under the sun. Such people in
our, or in any other class, are rare, and are,
I fancy, growing rarer. It can’t have escaped
your intelligent observation, that ninety-nine-hundredths
of the talk of to-day is about
persons, and, as a rule, about uninteresting
persons. The very fact that a subject is important,
that it concerns us, that it has some
bearing on our lives and thoughts, is sufficient
to bar it out of what we ridiculously call
“conversation.” Is anybody interested in
anything? I often ask myself on my way
home from a dinner or an evening out
somewhere.</p>

<p>But to return to this matter of the parental
or guardianly censorship of books. I am
convinced that if the censor could be all-wise,
and managed to use his restrictive powers
effectively, his censorship would work for
good. But in point of practical fact, not a
parent or a guardian of us all is all-wise,
or is able to make use of even such wisdom
as he has. An “effective blockade,” as they
call it in war time, over a young girl’s mind
is almost impossible to establish. All sorts
of contraband craft will manage to escape the
vigilance of the blockading squadron, do we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
what we may. Still, on the whole, the thing
is pretty thoroughly done in France. There
the novel, the novel of ordinary life, the
novel written by the best and most popular
writers of the day, or of past days, is never
suffered to fall into a young woman’s hands
at all. Books for girls are things apart.
They are written by inferior authors, and as
a rule are dull and insipid beyond words.
The French ideal of a young woman is that
until she is married her mind, so far as a
certain sort of knowledge is concerned, should
be a sheet of white paper. And in most
French families, outside Paris at any rate,
the ideal is fairly well realised. Now then, if
there be any value in that ideal—if it be an
ideal worth maintaining or worth following,
the outcome of it ought to be that the average
French married woman should have a higher
standard and habit of chastity and virtue than
her sister in England, where no such rigorous
supervision prevails. Well, she has not,
Alexa, I can confidently assure you of that.
Heaven forfend that I should say a word to
her discredit. She is often delightful, though
not quite so often as she herself imagines.
But in the matter of conduct—woman-conduct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
let us call it, for want of a better term—she
is not a bit better than our women
over here. Observe I do not say that she
is worse: to say that would be to be guilty
of vulgar and insular British Philistinism;
but to be quite safe I content myself by
saying that she is not a bit better, and
consequently, is not worth all the blockading
trouble that is taken with her. I have met
young French ladies who have been married
less than a year, and, well—I need not
amplify, but my intimacy with them has left
me with the conviction that it was sheer
waste of time and energy to be at such pains
to preserve for twenty years an innocence
that four or five months were enough so
completely to dissipate and to destroy.</p>

<p>The question, it seems to me, leads directly
to the larger issue: Is knowledge often hurtful?
I say “often,” not “ever,” for in this
life there are always exceptions. For the
exceptions we cannot, try we never so carefully,
provide. We must, willy-nilly, be
guided by general rules. In what other
department of life, then, is it even pretended
that knowledge, the fullest knowledge, works
for ill? Can you think of one? If a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
traveller were about to set out on a journey
through some country where grew in rich
luxuriance any number of tempting fruits,
beautiful to look upon, delectable to the
palate, but charged with deadly poison, and
certain seriously to injure or to slay outright
whosoever should pluck and eat, would it,
or would it not, be desirable that that
traveller should be furnished with all the
knowledge available as to the number and the
nature of these fruits, their habits of growth,
the particular places where they were most
likely to be found, the antidotes to their
several poisons? Would you, if you could,
prevent his reading printed treatises descriptive
of them, or even poems and dramas that
told of them in a poetic or a dramatic way?
Who would be most likely to come through
the journey unscathed—the traveller who was
ignorant, or the traveller who was knowledgable?
Surely the questions answer themselves.
It is true, of course, that even the
best-instructed voyager, hard put to it by
hunger or thirst, and face to face with the
temptation of some specially seductive fruit,
might even so pluck, eat, and perish. The
clamour of his senses might prove too urgent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
for the resistance of his intelligence. But
even so, by telling him all there was to tell,
you would have done your best for him,
wouldn’t you? And what poor chance
would the similarly-tempted ignoramus have?
Well, now, every young woman is just such
a traveller, and life is for her just such a
journey.</p>

<p>On my honour, I think I have put the
case as fairly and as squarely as I know how.
If knowledge be our safeguard, our only
safeguard, in every other of life’s journeys,
why in the name of all that is rational
should ignorance be our best protection in
this? Why should there be one little corner
in the house of life in which the light shall
not be suffered to shine?</p>

<p>You know Mr Findlater. He was here a
night or two ago, and was very angry because
one of his junior clerks, lately a Board School
boy, had been detected in a small forgery.
It was a very trifling affair, and did no harm
to anyone but the poor silly lad who had
been guilty of it. But Mr Findlater was
full to the brim of indignation. Not with
the lad—I’ll do him justice in that; he
didn’t even intend to prosecute, he told me—but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
with the whole system of national
education. “This is what comes of Board
Schools,” he declared. “You rate us for
teaching these gutter brats to write, and the
first use they make of their knowledge is to
forge our names to cheques!” He did really,
he said just that, and he is a man of not
much less than ordinary intelligence! And,
of course, if you come to think of it, if no
one were taught to write no one could commit
forgery, could they? And Mr Findlater’s
argument was quite as good as the arguments
of those who contend that a young woman’s
virtue is best established on a foundation of
ignorance.</p>

<p>And now it occurs to me that I have been
wasting all the time taken in writing this
letter. I feel sure that you put all this yourself,
and put it quite as well, to your friends
the other night. But then, you see, you
have the inestimable advantage of a wise as
well as a loving</p>

<h3>THE RIGHT SORT OF MAN</h3>

</div>

<p class="right"><i>April 28, 19—.</i></p>

<p>My surprise is not nearly so great, my dear
girlie, as you seemed to anticipate. I told
you, you remember, that I was good at guessing,
and I had already guessed this, or something
very like this. All the same it is a
blow, for a blow is none the less a blow
because one sees it coming. Indeed, recollections
of my sparring days seem to tell
me that the blow you see coming, and from
which you can escape neither by guard nor
duck, is just about the nastiest of all.</p>

<p>Fate is a desperately skilled antagonist.
It hammers us and hammers us, and knocks
us out at last; but we do manage to
get a punch or two back at someone or
something now and then ... and that is
good to remember. It is curious, isn’t it,
that this letter of yours, the subject of which
I suppose is Love, should have set me to write
about fighting? And yet ... I don’t know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
... they are never very far apart, Love
and Strife, are they? Love is the great
disintegrator, the breaker-up. See how he
is coming between you and me now!</p>

<p>You are “not exactly engaged, but ...”
I will not quote the end of your sentence,
for I know how irritating it is to have one’s
words given back to one. Well, it is good
of you to refer the final word on the matter
to me. Even the most unconventional
woman does wisely at great crises to respect
the established conventions. Her life is
made easier, less stormy so. But there! It
was unjust of me to say that. I will—no, will
has nothing to do with it—I do believe that
in leaving this, to you so intensely personal,
matter still open, so that I may have my say
on it, you have not been motived by a desire
to do the right, the correct thing in such
cases, but by a real belief and trust in me.
You have done it not because it is always
done, but because you are you, and I am I,
and we are to each other what we are.</p>

<p>But because you and I and this Third, this
Third to me so shadowy, yet so portentous,
to you, so substantial, are going to do all the
usual things, there is no reason why I should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
write them to you, is there? So I will not
express my gratification and my hopes, and
end with a stuffy little lecture inculcating a
prudential course of conduct. I will practise
up the heavy-father style so as to have it all
perfect by the time he (no, I will not give
him a capital “h,” though I note that you
do) comes to see me. How I hope that at
the first glimpse of him I shall feel that I
may drop it. Does he expect a heavy father,
I wonder. Well, if he does, he shall have
one; be sure of that.</p>

<p>The first glimpse of him! And I haven’t
had it yet! It is that which has given me
this queer indescribable sensation of unreality
from which I have been suffering ever since
I opened your letter this morning. By the
way I posted your other letter to your
mother on to her at once; she is staying
at Richmond until Friday. One always has
that curious, empty feeling when one part
of one’s mind fails to realise what another
part of one’s mind tells one is a fact. It is
thus we feel for the first few moments in
the presence of death. We know that it
has happened, but we can’t adjust our minds
to the knowledge. So to-day with me. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
know, or almost know, that your life, the
life of all others ... but there, I will not
be sentimental, so you fill in the rest ...
but your life is to be dominated—well, if
not dominated exactly, at anyrate directed
for good or ill or half of each, by a man
of whom I have never so much as caught
sight, of whose very name I am ignorant.</p>

<p>Do you know that you forgot to mention
his name? Not that it matters so long as
it isn’t anything very distressing. I am not
afraid of that, for you know the names to
which I object, and which I would rather
die than have my name connected with, and
I remember that you share my prejudices.
We both agreed, didn’t we, that Walter
Pater was justified when he refused to vote
a Fellowship at Oxford to a man named
Juggins or something. So I take it for granted
that your future name will be beyond the
reach of æsthetic criticism. It ought to be
a single syllable name, of course, so as to
go rightly with Alexa. Christian names of
two or three syllables should always be
followed by a surname of one.</p>

<p>But I take it you have seen to that.
You could not, I am sure, contemplate a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
life in which you would suffer from a spasm
of artistic horror every time you signed
your name.</p>

<p>Whatever he is you know well enough
that I shall not be glad of him, don’t you?
You know that I shall wish every time I
see or think about him that he had never
been born. You won’t mind that, because
if it were not so you would feel that your
father was not one of the right sort of
men. Truly, I don’t believe that the right
sort of men ever look forward to their
daughter’s marriages with anything but
fierce distaste. When it comes to the
point, I mean. They wouldn’t like them
not to be married, and they hate it when
they are. From which you will gather what
a mistake it is to be the right sort of man,
and what supreme folly it is to beget
daughters, anyway.</p>

<p>It is rum though, rum and inexplicable,
that feeling of savage resentment one has
against every other man who aspires to any
sort of intimacy with any woman for whom
one cares even a little. Of course, one
says to oneself that it is because one feels
that no other man is half good enough for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
her. It is quite astonishing how one can
lie to oneself. I know, for instance, when
I can get myself for a second or two into
a reasonable mood, that there must be at
least a hundred thousand or so of men in
England, not to mention the rest of the
world, who are quite half good enough for
you, and yet I hate with an incandescent
hatred the mere idea, the tenuous probability
that you will some day be married. If he,
the unnamed and unnamable, were to come
into this room now I should, or at least
should try to, break him up with my bare
hands and send the fragments of him home
in a cab.</p>

<p>It was Nero or Caligula, wasn’t it, who
expressed the genial wish that humanity
had only one head that he might cut it
off? Well, I believe that at the bottom
of every right-minded man’s heart there is
a lurking wish that all femininity were
compact and personified in one woman and
that she might belong to him. “Turkish?”
you smile. Oh, much more than Turkish;
primitive rather.</p>

<p>I shall not kill him, Alexa. I shall
probably be tremendously nice to him if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
he wears the right necktie. You might
give him a hint about that. One never
does do the things one most passionately
desires to do—they are always so outrageous
those passionately desired things.</p>

<p>Haven’t you often, when sitting at dinner,
say, with a lot of depressingly correct people,
ached and ached to rip out some hideous,
impossible, unspeakable expression, just to
watch their shocked, flabbergasted faces; and
then to disappear for ever from the cognisance
of man? I am sure you have; we
all have. But you have never done it,
thank heaven, and you know you never will.
It is almost irresistible that impulse, isn’t
it?</p>

<p>And yet we resist it every time. That
is because we are sane. If we yielded we
should be mad; that’s all. That is what
sanity means, the power to resist the almost
irresistible impulse. Well, I am sane, so
far. I shall offer him my hand and a chair.
Perhaps a cigar. I hope he smokes.</p>

<p>Oh yes, that reminds me. I must say just
this. If he does not smoke and if he refuse
wine at dinner in favour of water, or even of
whisky and soda—a hateful decadent modern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
habit—then I will have none of him, Alexa,
nor shall you. If the worst come to the
worst, I will convince him by ocular and
tactile demonstration that there is lunacy in
our family, and I am quite certain that a
fellow who neither smokes nor drinks wine
will never have the hardihood or enterprise
to face that. It is not that smoking or
wine drinking (at dinner) are in themselves
virtues, but they are indications of the only
temperament and attitude towards life which
are compatible with true virtue.</p>

<p>Mind, I will say nothing so widely embracing
as that a non-smoker and non-wine
drinker is not good for anybody—never mind
what I think, but I will not say it. What I
will say is that he would not be good enough
for you; for one of us. His very presence at
dinner and after would be a perpetual reproach,
a constant criticism. And you would not
like to be faced every evening by a criticism
and a reproach.</p>

<p>A man who, in a world of good things,
tobacco and wine and other things, abstains,
is a man who makes exacting demands upon
himself, and a man who makes exacting
demands upon himself will inevitably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
make exacting demands upon his womankind.</p>

<p>And now, while I am about it, I may as
well mention one or two other things, one or
two other essentials which any man must
possess before he can even begin to think of
connecting his name with ours. By the way,
it is you who will change your name, isn’t it?
What an intolerable thought that is. He
must be what the Scots call “gleg in the
uptak’;” he must divine what you mean
almost before you have said it, certainly
before you have said it all. He must not,
when you happen to speak a trifle elusively,
stare at you blankly for half a minute or so,
and then say, “I am afraid I don’t quite
follow you,” or look it without saying it, perhaps
the worst outrage of all, for the remark
does at least imply a consciousness of inferiority
and a sort of commendable humility.</p>

<p>A truly civilised woman, one of us, would
rather live with a Zulu (assegais and all)
who understood what she was after, than
with a thing in up-and-down collars (and
golf sticks) who was for ever asking her
to explain herself. Heavens, how I know
the look on the face of a woman after she has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
been married a year or two to that. No, the
man who marries you must talk our language,
think our thought, or there will be rocks
ahead on which you and I and he will get
ourselves badly grazed, not to say broken.</p>

<p>Then he must read and admire Henry
James. I say must read, not must have
read, for if he have not it may be only
his misfortune and the fault not of him, but
of his upbringing. The novels of Henry
James (we have agreed, you remember) are
the touchstone of the modern spirit. If a
man can’t understand them, or gets bored by
them, or wishes they were shorter or less
involved, then that man, whatever else he
may be, is not of us or even of our time. I
would rather see my daughter mated to a
megatherium than to a man who could not
“make out,” as they put it, the novels of
Henry James.</p>

<p>While I was on the subject of tobacco and
wine I ought to have added that he must not
be “anti” anything to any extent. Not anti-vaccination
or anti-vivisection, or anti-clerical,
or any of those things about which the faddist
rages. I don’t mean that he may not have
strong opinions, but he must not carry them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
to the point of being “anti.” When a man
reaches that point it always seems to me he
ceases to be human. A husband should be
human.</p>

<p>And then—I had nearly forgotten this,
that accursed feeling of unreality is so strong
upon me to-day—he must be a man whom
other women like and who likes all other
women, or nearly all, all that count. I know,
of course, that his voice changes and takes on
another tone when he speaks to you. That
is all right. But does it change and take on
another tone when he speaks to the other girl?
That’s the thing that matters. When he hands
a—oh, well, a cup, let us say, to a woman, does
he do it in an altogether different way to that
in which he would hand a cigar-case to a man?
If he doesn’t his wife will soon find herself
wishing that he had never handed anything
at all to her. A man’s love for “the one
woman,” is after all only in a quintessential,
concentrated form the emotion he has for
all other women, the generalised thing
particularised.</p>

<p>I don’t agree with the incorrect saying that
reformed rakes make the best of husbands,
but I do say that the man who has not in him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
the potentiality of rakehood should never be
trusted with a wife.</p>

<p>But there! What does it all amount to?
I write, but all the time I am writing I am
conscious that for all practical purposes I
might as well go and shoot peas at the sun
as direct these wise observations at a girl in
the first bloom of what they call love. Of
course, I know well enough that just now you
see in this intrusive Third all these qualities
and attributes upon which I have been insisting.
Or if you don’t you think they don’t
matter; and that I don’t matter; and that
even you don’t matter; that nothing matters
but this new magic that bandages your eyes
and carries honey to your lips. Could I have
chosen for you I would have scaled the heights
of heaven if haply I might bring down to you
a god, and ... you would not have liked
him dear. You would have asked for a man
instead. And you would have been right, for
you are not a goddess, but a girl and the
heart of my heart:—</p>

<h3>MODERN MARRIAGE</h3>

</div>

<p class="right"><i>May 3, 19—.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My dear Alexa</span>,—</p>

<p class="indent8">I resist gallantly the temptation to begin
much less formally, much more sentimentally
than that; but I feel that marriage is the
one subject on which a man may not be
sentimental. In matters of marriage it is
always sentiment that undoes us.</p>

<p>He called here yesterday afternoon, as by
this time you are no doubt aware, for I feel
pretty sure that as soon as he left he
scribbled a note to you from the nearest post-office.
If I know anything about men I
know that. I should not be at all surprised
if he telegraphed; but I hope not, for it is
bad to begin matrimonial enterprises by a
present to the Post Office.</p>

<p>So you see I have had a whole evening in
which to think him over; a night to sleep
upon my thoughts and a morning in which
to recast them, as it were. When I tell you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
that I really did sleep and that I found my
breakfast this morning not more hateful than
usual, you will realise that all is pretty much
as you would wish.</p>

<p>Yes, the man will do. Except that he is
a man, and that he wants to marry my
daughter, my critical eye can find no serious
fault in him. Of course I wish he were
dead or in some distant colony—but no, no,
I don’t dislike him quite so much as that
last would imply—but that wish of mine
means little or nothing that need worry you.
One so often does wish dead people in whom
one can find no fault—indeed, they are more
often than not the very people one can do
so well without.</p>

<p>I tried him by all the tests. I offered him
one of my very best cigars, the sort I never
have enough of in the house, and he smoked
it like a fellow of taste. Even when we
were talking seriously about serious matters—you
are a serious matter to him and to
me—he held it now and then so that the
perfumed smoke could titillate his nostrils.
Had it been a bad cigar and he had done
that, I should have known him for a charlatan
and sent him about his business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>He came in a frock coat too, a frock coat
fullish in the skirts—I hope you didn’t put
him up to that. Had he worn one of those
cut-away things that fasten with one button
in the middle of the waistcoat! Words fail
me as to what would have happened had he
worn one of those.</p>

<p>He knows how to sit in an arm chair
without getting into trouble with his elbows
or showing too much sock. Has it ever
occurred to you, Alexa, that in the matter
of the disclosure of ankles a man should be
as discreet as a woman?</p>

<p>We did not talk of you all the time. I
should have learnt little by permitting that,
for the veriest oaf can say the right things
about a girl with whom he is in love; but
we talked of books, of pictures, of music, of
cathedrals, of the things that really matter,
and he was all right there.</p>

<p>He has a good deal to learn, but then he
has some time in which to learn it; and if
you do justice to your upbringing he will
not lack a competent tutor. There—that’s
the prettiest compliment I have paid you for
many a long day.</p>

<p>Your mother was charmed with him. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
rather think she is writing to you at this
moment to tell you so. I confess that fact
does not vastly impress me, because mothers
look always with a friendly eye upon their
daughters’ suitors, supposing, of course, that
they are anywhere near the mark.</p>

<p>Has it ever struck you as queer and rather
significant that while women are always
anxious for their daughters to marry, men,
for the most part, boggle at the thought of
it? It looks almost as though your sex got
more out of the arrangement than ours,
doesn’t it? That if they stand to lose more,
as they indubitably do, they stand to win
more too?</p>

<p>The inveterate belief of women in the
glory and beauty of marriage always stupefies
me. I suppose there is not one married
woman alive who does not know at least half
a dozen others who have come hopelessly to
grief in their marriages, and yet they go on
believing! Such robust faith is touching
and a tremendous compliment to us.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is a wonderful institution this
marriage—marriage as it exists among
civilised people, I mean: civilised Western
people, I should add.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>I suppose if a committee of ingenious
men and women of the world had met
together to devise the scheme of sex relationship
best calculated to ensure unhappiness
to the two parties concerned, they could not
have hit upon anything more likely to secure
this object ... well, perhaps not unhappiness
exactly, but uncomfortableness, let us
say ... than modern marriage, monogamic
marriage.</p>

<p>From that point of view it is almost perfection.
The object of it would seem to
be to destroy as quickly as possible all the
feelings with which people start off on it.
The end, it would seem, is the negation of
the beginning. Rum!</p>

<p>Think, now. What is it that gives the
quintessential charm to that state of mind
we call being in love? What is the magic
of it? You can’t be expected to know just
now, because you are not in an analytical
mood; emotion of any kind is fatal to
accurate analysis.</p>

<p>Well then, I’ll tell you. It is romance—a
sense of strangeness, of something to be
discovered, of infinite, thrilling, and perilous
possibilities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>Why do sisters and brothers not fall in
love with each other? Not because to do
so would be “unnatural,” not a bit of it,
never believe that. Nature has nothing
whatever to do with it. It is because they
have been brought up together in close and
daily intimacy; because there is no romance,
no glamour of the undiscovered, no possibilities
just beyond the horizon line.</p>

<p>Now marriage, as we know it, is the
inevitable slayer of romance. Before the
intimacy of marriage romance disappears
like a mist wreath in the blazing sun.</p>

<p>Mind, I do not say that in losing romance
you lose everything; there are many other
things that are worth having, perhaps even
more worth having, but you lose romance,
and lose it in something less than six weeks.</p>

<p>And when you have lost romance you are
no longer “in love.” You may still love
and be loved. You do and are, if all things
go well with you, both; but you are no
longer “in love.” The very feelings which
attracted you to start with, which brought
you together, are gone, and gone for ever.</p>

<p>That is the stupendous fact of marriage;
it kills the thing that made it. It is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
outcome of illusion. People in love imagine
that marriage is a continuance of the feelings,
intensified, which they have for each other
before they enter upon it. That, Alexa, is
exactly what it is not. It is the very opposite
of that.</p>

<p>Most people will tell you—one hears it
said all about, especially just now—that the
reason why marriage is not the success it
might be is that married people “see too
much of each other.” There is something
in that, no doubt, but there is more not in
it, so to speak. It is not, I am convinced, so
much because married folk see each other
every day that romance takes wings; it is
rather because <i>they can make sure</i> of seeing
each other every day. It is the sense of
security that kills.</p>

<p>I verily believe that an odalisque in an
Oriental harem, for whom a visit from her
lord is some sort of an event, a thing which
may or may not happen on any particular
day, has a better emotional time of it than
the wife in a suburban villa who knows that
her husband will appear at the front door,
little black bag and all, ten minutes after she
has heard his train puff into the station, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
the still more unfortunate lady who can
always get speech of him by just calling up
the stairs.</p>

<p>Your poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti once
told a friend of his, and of mine, that all
those exquisite sonnets of his, dedicated to
his wife and to wedded love, were written
when Mrs Rossetti was away on long visits.
That I can well believe, and I believe moreover
that they were written not only when
she was away, but when he was not at all
sure when she would come back.</p>

<p>Once in a little walled town in the South
of France I saw a play in which the husband
and wife used to make assignations to meet
and dine in a private room at a restaurant,
although they had an excellent cook at home.
It was a silly little play, but the dramatist
knew something of human nature and of
marriage, all the same. Poor dears, they
were trying after something which they
could not get, of course, but still, the very
fact that they did try proves something,
doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Intimacy, security—these are the fatal
diseases of marriage. I think I see you gibe
a little at the word “security,” and murmur<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
something cynical about divorce. You are
right in a way and wrong in another way.
One has only to look around one to learn
that marriage is by no means synonymous
with security; but all of us, when we marry,
believe it is, and so the result is the same.</p>

<p>Mention of divorce suggests to me to say
this. I don’t believe that the sort of thing
which leads to the divorce court, and, where
quite uncivilised people are concerned, to the
Old Bailey, is half so often, as most suppose,
the outcome of wilful incontinence or of
sheer naughtiness, no, nor even of the
waning of love. It is the passion for something
that marriage does not satisfy—the
passion for Romance. The unfortunates
yearn, yearn with an irresistible yearning, for
something to happen, something unusual,
something with a spice of danger in it, something
which pulls at the heart’s strings,
something to make one wake up in the
morning with a feeling that the eggs and
bacon for breakfast are not the most exciting
prospect of the day. Ah, heaven! Don’t
we all know it—the coldest, the oldest, the
most austere of us!</p>

<p>I formed this opinion entirely out of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
own head years ago, and it was curiously
confirmed by an experience of three days
I once spent in the divorce court. It was
when I had that tiresome Chancery suit—you
remember, about Ida’s marriage settlement—and
I had to waste a lot of time in
the law courts.</p>

<p>I could not sit and listen to the Chancery
counsel prosing over technicalities, and so I
passed the days in a court which touches
human nature a trifle more shrewdly and less
expensively.</p>

<p>In those three days I saw about a dozen
cases tried and disposed of. And what sort
of people do you think they were who came
there with and against their wills? The
gay, the frivolous, the debonnair? Oh, dear
me, no; not in the least. I saw not one
gallant gentleman, not one lovely lady. On
the contrary, they were the dusty, the dowdy,
the humdrum, and, this is the odd thing, the
middle-aged! They were the kind of
women who make their own hats, make them
very badly, and talk about their servants at
afternoon tea; and of men who go up to
town at 8-45 of a morning, and come home
by the 6-15. Some of them, of course, had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
occasionally lost the 6-15, and that was where
the trouble began.</p>

<p>It is grossly unfair to the aristocracy to
say that it is they who keep the divorce court
going. “Aristocratic divorce cases,” as the
Radical papers absurdly call them, make not
one per cent. of the whole. It is the dull,
stodgy middle-class among whom immorality
is rampant! And it is just because they are
dull, stodgy, and middle-class.</p>

<p>The pleasures, the emotional outlets of
art, the distractions which intelligence can
always find in the world, are closed against
them. Meanwhile, beneath their commonplace
domesticity the passion for Romance,
though smothered, smoulders on. One fine
day, on the most ridiculously inadequate
provocation, it bursts into a flame and then—“decree
<i>nisi</i> with costs.”</p>

<p>Poor devils, poor, poor devils, they haven’t
brains enough to outwit a Slaters’ detective
or even a prying housemaid.</p>

<p>Brains, ah! yes. Brains are your stand-by
in marriage as in most other of life’s perplexities,
Alexa. It is brains that keep you
out of matrimonial troubles, and even, when
in a slack moment, you do get into difficulties,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
it is brains that will pull you out of
them.</p>

<p>Looking at those of my personal acquaintances
who have come bad croppers over
their marriages, I find that in every case
there has been want of wit on one side or the
other, often on both. Brains! That is why
I have considerable confidence in your
future, my daughter.</p>

<p>One word more. Romance, in-loveness,
cannot survive six weeks of the appalling
intimacy of marriage. That is past praying
for. What shall follow its departure then?
Mere emptiness, a tramp across a sandy
desert or a treacherous bog? That depends.
The thing that should follow is
friendship, friendship of a peculiar, a
unique, sort; friendship touched by tenderness,
mixed with memories, coloured by
emotion.</p>

<p>But again remember this—it takes as much
brains to build up and to maintain a friendship
of that kind as it does to ... well ...
more than it does to do anything else in the
world so well worth doing. Fools may make
satisfactory lovers, only the wise can be
lasting friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

be at Paddington to meet you. See to it

<h3>THE SUBTLE SOMETHING</h3>

</div>

<p class="right"><i>June 5, 19—.</i></p>

<p>It is all right, child. I have not a
word of blame, not a word of criticism even.
You are valiant and original. I am sorry,
of course, sorry for you, sorry for
him, for myself, for everyone remotely
concerned. But I am congratulatory too. I
congratulate you, him, and myself. You
are prepared for blame of course, for blame
from everybody but your own consciousness
and your own father. A young woman who
engages herself to a man, remains engaged
for nearly a month and then “breaks it off”
when there is no conventionally agreed-upon
cause for the rupture is, in the eyes
of the world, a jilt. It can’t be helped. It’s
no use grumbling. The world will have its
labels—and small blame to it, they spare it the
trouble of thinking, of exercising the faculty
of discrimination. And we upon whom its
labels are stuck, must just grin and wear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
them. Let us see to it that we do grin and
wear them—with a grace.</p>

<p>That “subtle something” of which you
can’t say more even to me—there is no need
of greater definiteness, I, as always, understand—is
the true, almost the only, irremovable
hindrance to happiness in marriage, the
marriage of sensible people. Anything does
to make fools unhappy. It is unpardonable
and unforgettable. Unpardonable, because
it is not a deed or even a thought or a look;
unforgettable because it is always there.
And the worst of it is, it can by its very
nature discover itself only in intimacy. One
has to jump into the water before one finds
out with certainty that one can’t swim.
That subtle something, so colossal, so inexpugnable
yet so elusive! What is it?
Where is it? Is it in the blood, or in the
brain, or is it some attribute of that unthinkable
but must-be-thought-of entity, the Transcendental
Ego? I hate to seem so grossly
materialist, but I think it is in the blood, and
will be discovered some day by chemical
analysis, or by an improved microscopy;
caught and put into a little bottle.</p>

<p>At present only something finer than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
chemical analysis, personal perceptiveness to
wit, can discern it, and it must be the personal
perceptiveness of the one most interested.
All the others must needs be the veriest
bunglers. That is why I am not kicking
myself to any extent for having thought, in
my blindness, my inevitable blindness, that
he was all right, that he would do. He
would have done for me, but how could
I know that he would not have done for
you? And yet I did just once have the
vaguest, dimmest, shadowiest ghost of a
suspicion that all was not quite well. It
scurried past me that thought, that thought
that was not quite a thought, across the
darkness of my mind as a small mouse
scurries across a dark room. It was one
night when you had been seeing him off
downstairs and we were all in the drawing-room.
When you came back I caught a look
upon your face ... no, something less than
that ... just a flicker across your lips ...
and it made me uneasy, gave me a tiny
twinge in that rickety old heart of mine, it
kept me awake for an hour or two, as a
mouse, fidgeting, has often done.</p>

<p>I am glad of one thing though; that
except in the matter of which I could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
judge, I did not judge him wrongly. He <i>is</i>
made of the right stuff. I had a letter from
him last night—a letter from a man to a
man. He doesn’t whine, he doesn’t rage,
he doesn’t wrangle. He doesn’t even
complain. He accepts the inevitable. I
think the final test of a man is his attitude
in face of the inevitable. I will never show
you that letter—of course you would not
wish it. I feel in a curious way as though
it were I and not you who had hurt him.</p>

<p>Once more then, my daughter, you are
right. You have done well. Let no
misgivings on that point ever gnaw or even
nibble. There are not many things that can
justify the breach of a betrothal deliberately
entered upon. That subtle something is
one of them. Had the case been reversed,
had it been he instead of you who had made
the discovery, I should have said the same.</p>

<p>Now let the subject be dropped for ever.
We will not even refer to it, no, not by
a look, when you come home next week.</p>

<p>The object of this book is to add interest to
rambles in London by a careful alphabetical
record of the homes and haunts of the distinguished
literary men and women who are no
longer living. In many cases, as is duly noted,
the houses themselves are still standing; in
others the sites are definitely pointed out, and
short extracts are given from biographies, showing
with what particular events in the lives of their
occupants these residences are identified. London
is full of memories, and this volume is an ideal
guide book to its literary landmarks.</p>

beauty of the writing. Her atmosphere is delightful.
The Eastern stories are full of the colour and the
atmosphere of the East. No one can do anything

Eastern buildings and gardens. It makes no
difference to Victoria Cross whether she is
writing of India or Damascus or Omdurman, she
invests them all with an atmosphere which is not
only enchanting but carries the stamp of truth
on it.”</p>

<p>A thrilling story of mystery and imagination. It is an
attempt to show how, given immense histrionic genius, a
man without principle might use it to the confusion of
Society and be responsible for seemingly inexplicable
mysteries. The romance deals with modern days in
London, and a phase of life hidden largely from
Londoners themselves. An astonishing murder opens
the way to the story, and the coroner’s inquest introduces
to the reader one of the most original characters
in modern sensational fiction. From the lodging-houses,
clubs, and theatres of the metropolis, the scene changes
to London Docks, thence to mid-ocean, and finally to
the West Indies. There the mystery of “The Sinews of
War,” becomes at last unravelled and a title that will
puzzle the reader until the end, is explained.</p>

<p>This work is scientific and up to date; all technical
and misleading terms are omitted, and the diseases are
classified alphabetically and under their popular names.</p>

<p>The treatment is scientific and simple and nothing is
advised that cannot be carried out at home.</p>

<p>The description of complicated symptoms and treatment
is avoided.</p>

<p>The signs of severe illnesses are given, so that the
disease may be recognised and the patient comforted by
simple home remedies till skilled help is obtained.</p>

<p>The want of a little medical or surgical knowledge has
led to the loss of many lives which might have been
saved, and this book conveys to the unskilled reader in a
few trenchant and simple sentences the best way to act
in all emergencies.</p>

Gaspar di Salo, Maggini, Amati, to Stradivarius are described,
the whole being interspersed with many anecdotes about makers

<p>The pictures are delightfully uncommon, comprising as they

family from the ninth century. The whole work is full of
interesting information and is written in a bright and unconventional
manner.</p>

<p>This is a novel which will assuredly create a great sensation. The
brilliant authoress was barely 18 when the Academy crowned her
first volume of poems, “Chants d’Aurore.”</p>

<p>The close friendship between the Queen of Roumania, Carmen
Sylva, and Hélène Vacaresco is well known, and also the romance
of the projected marriage between the young poet and the royal
prince of Roumania; this project was abandoned for State reasons,
but it created an idyllic and legendary atmosphere round the
authoress.</p>

<p>Her book, while pure fiction, may be said to mirror the mode of
living and sentiments of certain royal personages, and probably no
more intimate picture of Court Life from the inside has ever been
published. It is a story full of passion and interest.</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
